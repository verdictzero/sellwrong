/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the texture pack
   =====================================================================

   Every other texture in this game is DRAWN, in the page, at start-up
   (js/textures.js). These are not: they are two sets of pictures the
   user handed over — concrete, grass, dirt, cliffs, the ops-room panels,
   the reactor strip, doors, water, an office, backdrops, test tiles —
   and they stay as files in assets/textures (tools/build-texpack.py),
   loaded at run time and put in the same TextureBank under their own
   names, so a map can wear one on any surface exactly as it wears a
   drawn one.

   THEIR SCALE. The panels, doors and floors are drawn at TWICE Doom's
   resolution: a door is 128 by 256 pixels here where Doom's was 64 by
   128 units, and a floor is 256 square where Doom's flats were 64. So a
   picture from the pack spans HALF its pixel size in world units, which
   puts every door in it at 64 by 128, the size of a Doom door and of
   HOUSDOOR in this game. The exceptions are worn one texel to the unit:
   DR1, which is 64 by 128 already; the test tiles, which say their own
   size on them (64TEST reads "64px"); the DEBUG tiles and the one 64px
   office tile.

   THE ANIMATED ONES are animated Doom's way (ANIMATED in the WAD, the
   animdefs table in p_spec.c): a run of pictures with the same stem,
   each shown for EIGHT TICS of the 35 a second — or its own number of
   them, see ANIMS — round and round for as long as the map is running. And, as in Doom, EVERY picture in a run
   animates, not just the first: a wall that wears DEVPAN1E starts its
   cycle at E, so two walls side by side can be out of step on purpose.
   None of these is a switch — a switch in Doom is a pair that changes
   once, when used, and this pack has none — so every run loops.

     DEVPAN1A-L  the ops panel, its lamp going round the colours
     DEVPAN2A-H  the dial, its ring turning
     DR1_01-12   the small door's eye, cycling
     EYEDOOR0-8  the big door's eye, cycling
     EYEDORC0-4  and the big door's eye pulsing green, which is what it
                 does when it is open — EYEDOORC is the same door held
                 on the one green, and it does not move
     REACTB00-04 the reactor strip, the beam running along it
     WFALLA1-4   the waterfall
     WAT201-224  the water
     TESTPA00-74 the television test card

   Frames are swapped by pointing the bank's own three.js texture at the
   next picture, so every material wearing one follows, in the editor's
   3D view and in the game alike; a texture only goes up to the card when
   something drawn is wearing it, so a run nobody is looking at costs
   nothing.

   THE SKIES. The pack had seven skyboxes, six faces each (one came with
   five, and its sixth is made from the two beside it). The sky in this
   game is a sphere wearing a panorama (js/sky.js), so each box was
   turned into one offline — its four sides joined edge to edge and its
   top and bottom turned till they met them — and they are in
   assets/skies. A map picks one with world.skybox; with none, the sky
   is the painted gradient it always was.
