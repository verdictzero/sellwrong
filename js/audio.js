   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — noises
   =====================================================================

   Synthesised, not sampled. Same reason as the textures: nothing to
   load, nothing to license, and everything comes out of one place so it
   all sits together. Six primitives — a noise burst, a tone sweep, a
   click, a thud, a hiss and a crackle — and every sound in the game is
   some arrangement of those.

   Sounds are POSITIONED. A fire two aisles over is quieter than one
   behind you, and that is most of what a Doom soundscape does for you:
   it tells you what is in the room before you can see it.
   Distance attenuation only — no panning — because Doom did not pan
   either and stereo separation on a thing you cannot see turns out to be
   less useful than it sounds.
   ===================================================================== */

/* THE SYNTHESISED SOUNDS ARE OFF FOR NOW, at the user's request. One
   switch: with it on, play() refuses every name in DEFS below and the
   ambience never starts, so no oscillator is ever made. Every sound in
   the table is still defined and still asked for by the game; flip
   this and they are all back.

   WHAT IT DOES NOT SILENCE IS A SAMPLE. The minigun arrived with three
   recordings of its own (SAMPLES below), at the user's request, and
   those play whatever this says: the switch is about the noises this
   file makes up, not about the ones the user made. */

   transient and two layers of discharge. Fetched at boot, decoded once there is
   a context, and played by the same play() as everything else — a
   name in SAMPLE_FOR is a sample, and everything else is synthesised

   A .wav does not loop. `src.loop = true` sends the playhead from the

   on a zero crossing with matching phase on both sides — which no
   recording of a real coil ever is — that jump is a step in the
   waveform, which is a click, once every two seconds, for the whole
   seven seconds the trigger is down. The user heard it and asked for it
   fixed, and the fix is not a fade on playback: it is to make a buffer
   that is ACTUALLY periodic, once, when the file decodes. See
   _loopify, which is where it happens and where the argument for doing
   it that way rather than with a pair of crossfading sources is
   written out.

   The number is the join, in seconds. Long enough to hide the splice in
   a continuous texture; short enough that the loop is still most of the

     A BUFFER THAT IS ACTUALLY PERIODIC

     The ordinary answer to a clicking loop is to play two copies half a
     period apart and crossfade between them for ever, so the seam of
     one is covered by the middle of the other. It works, and it is the
     wrong answer HERE, for one reason: this loop is pitch-ramped. The
     whole point of it is that the coil rises as it charges (see
     Player.lanceVoice), and a playback rate that climbs from 0.72 to
     1.45 is a loop period that shrinks by half over seven seconds. A
     crossfade scheduled against a period that is moving has to be
     rescheduled continuously, and any drift puts the fade somewhere
     other than over the seam — which is a click again, at a moment you
     cannot predict.

     So the join is baked into the SAMPLES instead, once, at decode, and
     after that the buffer is genuinely periodic: the last sample and
     the first are neighbours in the original recording, so the wrap is
     not a discontinuity at any playback rate at all. One source, no
     scheduling, and the pitch can do whatever it likes.

     HOW: a buffer of length L becomes one of length n = L - X. The
     middle is copied straight through. The first X samples are the
     head mixed with the TAIL that was cut off, equal power, the tail
     fading out as the head fades in — so position 0 of the loop IS
     sample n of the original, which is the sample that followed n-1,
     which is the last sample of the loop. The join is exact.

     Equal power (cos/sin) rather than a straight line because the two
     sides are different parts of the same continuous noise and so are
     uncorrelated: summed linearly their energy dips in the middle of
     the fade, which is audible as a breath. cos² + sin² = 1 does not.
