/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the rain
   =====================================================================

   A box of streaks round the camera, and nothing else. Two thousand
   particles, one draw, none of them simulated against anything but the
   floor: a raindrop is a thing you see for a third of a second and it
   does not need to know what a wall is.

   IT DOES NOT FALL INDOORS, which in a sector engine is free: a drop
   is spawned only where the sector under it has the sky for a ceiling,
   and dies at the floor. A gutted region has lost its roof and gets
   the rain; the fuel grid knows the same fact (see rainOn in
   js/fire.js), which is how burning the roof off a building lets the
   weather start putting the rest of it out.

   IT LEANS WITH THE WIND, the same two numbers the smoke drifts on and
   the fires spread by (js/weather.js), because rain that fell straight
   down past smoke going sideways would be the one thing in the frame
   giving the game away.

   It is drawn with the world's own shading, so a drop in the dark is
   dark and a drop in front of the fire is lit by it, and it takes the
   air like everything else.
