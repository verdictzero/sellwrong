/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — tracers
   =====================================================================

   THE MINIGUN'S ROUNDS ARE SEEN, at the user's request. A round in this
   game is a hitscan — it has arrived before the tic is over — so a
   tracer is not the round, it is a streak of light drawn along the
   line the round took, from the muzzle to wherever it stopped, moving
   fast enough to read as flight and gone when it gets there. Every
   other round is one, which is how a belt is loaded. It is VERY LONG,
   at the user's request — four hundred and twenty units, a good part
   of the way down an aisle — and it starts at the end of the barrel:
   the head leaves the muzzle and the tail stays there until the
   streak is its full length, so what you see is a line of light
   drawn out of the gun rather than one appearing in front of it.

   A STREAK IS A QUAD THAT FACES YOU ALONG ITS LENGTH: two corners at
   the tail, two at the head, spread sideways along the direction that
   is across both the streak and the line to the eye, so it is a line
   of light from wherever you stand and never a sliver seen edge-on.
   Bright at the head, dying toward the tail, additive, its own light.
   One draw call for the lot.

   Positions are GAME coordinates (x, y across the map, z up); the mesh
   is built in three's (x, z, -y) like everything else.

/* THE TAIL NEVER LEAVES THE MUZZLE BEHIND. A streak this long would
   otherwise hang out of the back of the gun and through the eye for
   its first two tics; so the tail is the head less the length, held at
   the muzzle until the head has flown a whole length — the streak
   GROWS out of the barrel, the way one does — and once the head has
   arrived it is the tail that keeps flying, shrinking the streak into
   the hit, until nothing is left. That is `trav`: how far the head
   would have flown by now, past the hit or not. */
