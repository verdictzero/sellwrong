   SELLWRONG — the flame
   =====================================================================

   What comes out of the gun. Not a cone of damage applied to a list —
   that is what it was, and it set fire to everything within four
   metres of the player the instant the trigger went down, including
   the player. It is a STREAM now: a few particles a tic leave the
   nozzle at speed, in a slight spread, and fly. They slow in the air,
   they drop, and where one lands it puts heat into the world — the
   store's fuel grid, the forest's, whatever it hit. So the flame goes
   where you point it, it reaches, and it arcs down to the floor a
   dozen metres out unless you lift the nozzle, which is the whole
   feel of a flamethrower and is why one is fun to hold.

   THE NUMBERS ARE PER TIC, like everything else in the game. Thirty
   units a tic is about a thousand a second; with the drag below a
   particle has covered four hundred units before its life runs out,
   and gravity has it on the floor a little before that when fired
   level. That is the reach, and `streamReach` computes it so the
   smoke test can hold it to a number.

   HEAT, NOT ACCELERANT. The strength put into the fuel grid stays
   under the threshold the fire system uses to lay accelerant, so the
   flame lights what is there and never makes bare lino burn — that is
   the bottle's job. What it does do is start a fire exactly where it
   lands, which in a shop full of stock is enough.
