/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — THE GRID
   =====================================================================

   A TEST AREA, and that is all it is: a large walled-off green grid
   with a crowd standing on it and every gun in the rack in your hands.
   At the user's request it holds nothing else — nothing to burn,
   nothing to burn it with, nobody coming up a road.

   WHAT IS ARCHIVED RATHER THAN GONE, because all of it comes back:

     the superstore and the town   js/maps/sellwrong.js, js/maps/town.js
     the fire simulation           js/fire.js, and `noCellFire` below
     the burning boxes             js/boxes.js, and `boxes` below
     the responders                js/responders.js, js/brigade.js, and
                                   `noSquads` below
     the lo-fi picture             js/lofi.js and js/palette.js, turned
                                   down to a pass-through in js/main.js

   Every one of those is still in the repository, still exported and
   still tested. Nothing here deletes them; this map simply does not ask
   for them, and js/main.js does not build them. Putting the world back
   is turning these switches over.

   THE MEASUREMENTS. One CELL is 64 units, which is Doom's grid and the
   ruler the rest of the game is already cut to — a shopper is 62 tall,
   a door is 128 high. The field is 10,240 units square, which you can
   see across on a clear night (airFar is 14,000) and cannot walk out
   of.

   IT IS ONE RECTANGLE. The floor used to be cut into hundreds of strips
   because there were boxes standing in it and a sector in this engine
   is one ring of points and cannot have an island in the middle. With
   nothing standing on it the whole field is a single sector and four
   one-sided lines: about ten triangles for the entire world, which is
   what a test area for guns and crowds ought to cost.
