/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the forest, and it burns
   =====================================================================

   The parade stands in the middle of a wood that runs for miles: a
   flat plain of firs and undergrowth, thousands of them, with the car
   park cut out of the middle. It exists to be set on fire. A
   supermarket burning down is a night's work; a forest burning down is
   weather, and watching a front you started walk off toward the
   horizon on its own is the other half of the game.

   TWO THINGS, KEPT APART. The SIMULATION is a grid of 64-unit cells
   with a byte of state each — green, alight, gone — and a list of the
   ones currently burning. It is pure typed arrays and can run for an
   hour in Node with no renderer, which is how the smoke test checks
   that a spark actually takes the wood and roughly how long it takes.
   The DRAWING is instanced billboards: every plant in the forest is one
   entry in a buffer, and each kind of plant is one draw call, so fifty
   thousand trees cost about what ten do. `build()` is the only place
   the two meet.

   THE ART IS FROM THE GOLF PROJECT, and so is the fire. Each sprite
   comes with a BURN MAP baked from its own pixels — where the coals
   sit, how black it ends, WHEN each texel catches, how leafy it is —
   and one number per plant swept across that map takes it from green
   through scorched, alight and charred without a second set of art.
   The shader below is that mechanism ported: a tree is never uniformly
   on fire, it has a burning band climbing it, with green above and
   char below, and the coals it leaves cycle through the ember palette.

   THE GROUND BURNS WITH IT. One texel of the burn grid per cell,
   sampled with filtering under a ground shader that crossfades forest
   floor into charred dirt — so a burnt patch of wood is black to the
   ground and stays that way, which is what makes a fire feel like it
   happened rather than played.

   WHAT SPREADS. Every cell of forest is fuel — the floor is dry needle
   litter — and a cell with a tree in it burns hotter and longer and
   throws fire further. There is a wind, from the west, and the fire
   moves with it about three times as readily as against it. That is
   the whole model, and it percolates: light one tree anywhere and,
   left alone, the whole wood goes, at walking pace downwind and a
   crawl into the wind. The player with a flamethrower is much faster
   than waiting, which is the point of carrying one.

  /* ---- AND WHAT THE TOWN PLANTS -----------------------------------
     Broadleaves, which the wood has none of: it is a conifer wood and
     the town is a town, and a street of firs is a town in a national
     park. These are photographs, cut out of their chroma key and given
     a burn map by tools/bake-plants.mjs, and they land in
     assets/forest/ in the same two files every fir already had.

     THE WEIGHT IS ZERO ON EVERY ONE OF THEM, which is what keeps them
     out of the wood: the scatter in _plant picks by weight and skips
     anything at nought, so not one of these is ever planted by the
     forest itself. They arrive through _plantTown, from the list
     js/maps/town.js builds, at a position somebody chose.

     THE ASPECT IS THE ARTWORK'S and not the tile's. Every tile here is
     128 by 256 because that is what the wood's are and powers of two
     are cheap; the photographs are nearer two to three, so the tile is
     squashed going in and stretched coming out, and what you see is
     the shape of the tree that was photographed. */

/* THE PLANTING, taken from github.com/verdictzero/golf's own vegetation
   scatter and its documentation of why it is shaped this way.

   ONE CELL GROWS ONE CLASS, and the three weights are a PRIORITY rather
   than three independent probabilities. Firs take their share first and
   are never squeezed — the canopy is the forest, and thickening the
   undergrowth must not thin it. Bushes take theirs out of what the
   trunks left, through a THRESHOLDED clump noise, so scrub arrives in
   thickets rather than as an even speckle over everything. Ground cover
   fills whatever is still empty, which is not a demotion: it is the
   definition of a ground layer, and it thins out on its own exactly
   where the trunks and the thickets are dense.

   AND THE UNDERSTORY IS SEVERAL PLANTS PER CELL. That is the density
   dial that is nearly free: one accepted cell, one hash, several
   jittered plants. Over there ferns are twelve to a cell and two thirds
   of every plant in the world.

   The pairs are (deep in a wood, out in the open), interpolated by the
   wood mask. Open is near zero for firs and for cover on purpose, so
   where the wood is and is not is exactly the shape of that contour;

    /* ONE MESH PER KIND PER CHUNK, and that is the whole of how a much
       thicker wood costs less than a thin one did.

       The cost of this forest is LINEAR IN INSTANCES SUBMITTED and has
       nothing to do with how much of the screen they cover: measured in
       a software rasteriser, a hundred thousand plants cost a second a
       frame whether they were drawn as a wall of green or collapsed to
       nothing by the fade in the vertex shader. Collapsing the quad
       saves the fill; it does not save the vertex, and the vertex was
       the bill.

       So the plants are cut into square chunks of ground and each chunk
       is its own draw. A chunk gets a real bounding sphere, so three.js
       frustum-culls the two thirds of the wood that is behind you for
       free; and each kind hides the chunks past its own fade range, so
       the fern carpet — which is most of the plants and is invisible at
       two thousand units — is submitted for the ground you are standing
       on and nowhere else. What reaches the GPU is a few thousand of a
       hundred and seventy thousand.

       The draw calls go up, from one a kind to a few a kind, and that
       is the trade: a handful of draws against a hundred thousand
       vertices, which is not a close call. */
    /* AND THE CHUNKS HAVE THREE SIZES, WHICH IS THE LOD. A tree at a
       distance is the same four vertices as a tree up close, so there
       is nothing to make cheaper about the tree; what there is to make
       cheaper is the DRAW. With 2048-unit chunks and the firs kept to
       sixteen thousand, the wood in front of you is two or three
       hundred draws a kind — and a draw is the thing a phone runs out
       of first. So the firs and the bushes are built three times over
       into 2048, 4096 and 8192-unit chunks of the same plants, and each
       frame every patch of ground is drawn from exactly ONE of the
       three: fine near the eye, where frustum culling wants small
       pieces, coarse at range, where forty small pieces are one. The
       rule that makes it exact is in render(): a coarse chunk is drawn
       only when every fine chunk under it is far enough to be, and a
       fine chunk only when neither of its parents is. The understory
       stays fine — its range is short enough that it is a handful of

         A burning fir carries its flame at the tree's own x and y, and
         both of them are quads yawed to face the camera plane — which
         makes them PARALLEL SURFACES AT THE SAME DEPTH. The depth test
         cannot separate two of those: it comes out per pixel, differently
         every frame as the eye moves, and a fire in a tree turns into a
         shimmering checkerboard of fire and leaves. Drawing order does
         not fix it, because the fault is that the depths are equal, not
         the order they arrive in.

         So the flame is stepped ALONG THE LINE TO THE EYE, and shrunk by
         the same fraction as it comes. That pair is the whole trick: a
         perspective projection is a scaling about the eye, so a quad
         moved a tenth of the way in and made a tenth smaller lands on
         exactly the same pixels at exactly the same size. Nothing about
         the picture changes. The only thing that changes is the depth it
         writes, which is what was wrong.

         How far: a share of the flame's OWN SIZE, so a fire big enough to
         swallow a fir clears the whole of it and one guttering on the
         ground barely moves, plus a share of the RANGE, because a depth
         buffer's resolution falls away with the square of the distance
         and a step that separates them at fifty units is nothing at two
         thousand. Never more than halfway, so a flame you are standing
