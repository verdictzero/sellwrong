   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the gunship
   =====================================================================

   CLOSE AIR SUPPORT COMES WITH THE ARMY, at the user's request, and it
   is the user's model: a tilt-engine VTOL, a three-barrel vulcan in a
   turret under the nose, a searchlight beside the gun, two nacelles
   on the wing and a third engine in the tail. The file came with the
   answers in it — a marker sphere inside the gun for where the rounds
   leave, one inside the lamp module for where the light does, and the
   nodes NAMED for what they are: a left-right parent, an up-down
   parent, a gun that spins. tools/prep-model.mjs reads the two spheres
   into the file's extras (`markers`, in the frame of the part each
   sits in) and takes them out of the mesh; this reads the names.

   IT IS NOT A VEHICLE, in the js/vehicles.js sense, though it borrows
   the vehicles' paint, their pieces and their arithmetic. A vehicle is
   one mesh with one transform; this is a TREE of them — the turret
   yaws on the nose, the gun pitches in the turret and spins on its
   own axis, the lamp pitches with the gun, the nacelles tilt on the
   wing and the tail engine tilts with them — because everything the
   user asked it to do is a part moving against another part. Each
   part is its own mesh in the vehicles' own material (js/car.js's
   carMesh, so it is lit, fogged, charred and burnt by the same shader
   the vans are), hung off three.js groups that are turned every frame
   from numbers the simulation owns. Seven draw calls for one aircraft.

   HOW IT FLIES. Not on a route: on a CONTROLLER. Every tic it wants
   to be somewhere — a point on a slow orbit round you at a standoff,
   the fire lane in front of the doors if you are indoors, or, every
   so often, directly over a knot of people — and it accelerates
   toward that point under a cap, at an altitude it holds with a
   spring, and it faces the way it is going or faces you when it is
   not going anywhere. That is the whole of the flight, and the rest
   is what the airframe does ABOUT the flight, which is the part the
   user asked for: THE NACELLES TILT, physically. A tilt-engine
   aircraft hovers on thrust pointed down and moves by pointing some
   of it backward, so the nacelle angle each tic is the angle of the
   thrust vector the controller just asked for — atan of the forward
   acceleration plus the drag it is pushing against, over the lift —
   and they tilt back when it brakes, forward as it cruises, and
   DIFFERENTIALLY when it yaws, one forward and one back, which is
   how a machine with no tail rotor turns. The body pitches a little
   against the tilt and banks INTO a turn, because it is held up by
   thrust and not by springs — the same reasoning as the APC's, one
   storey higher. The tail engine tilts with the pair and a little
   more, doing what a tail does.

   THE JET WASH is the exhaust arriving. Each engine's exhaust is a
   ray from the nacelle along the way its thrust is not pointing, and
   where that ray meets something — the tarmac, a wall, the roof of a
   car under it — is where the grit is thrown (Effects.wash), outward
   along whatever it landed on, harder the nearer the engine. AND IT
   IS HOT. Anybody standing where an exhaust lands while the aircraft
   is low CATCHES, at the user's request — people, not cars: it is
   the person the wash reaches and the person who is ignited, through
   Actor.ignite, and never the floor under them, which is the one call
   that would light the vehicles. So it hovers over a crowd and the
   crowd starts running with the fire on it, which is what it is for.

   THE VULCAN is the minigun's own tracer (js/tracers.js) fired the
   other way: three rounds a tic through Game.hitscan, level with the
   turret, each a hitscan with its own scatter, in bursts with a pause
   between, and the streak off every one of them from the muzzle
   marker to wherever it landed. There is no muzzle flash on the
   drawing — the user did not want one on their minigun either — and
   in its place a FLARE: the searchlight's own flare, small and warm,
   flickering at the muzzle while it fires.

   THE SEARCHLIGHT IS A FLARE AND NOTHING ELSE, at the user's request.
   It was a lit cone in the world shader for an afternoon — pointed
   where the turret points, no shadows, on every surface that shades
   with worldShade — and the user has had the beam taken out. What is
   kept is the thing you actually read a searchlight by at night, which
   is the LAMP ITSELF: a massive anamorphic flare, a screen-facing quad
   whose shader draws a horizontal streak most of the screen wide,
   thin, blue-white, with a gradient sphere at the centre of it,
   brightest when the reflector is pointed at you and falling away as
   it swings off.

   AND IT IS OCCLUSION AWARE, at the user's request — which, for a
   thing drawn over the top of the frame with the depth test off, means
   the three tests are made by hand, every frame, for each flare:

     BEHIND THE EYE   a flare is sized by its own DISTANCE so that it
                      stays the same size on the screen wherever the
                      lamp is, and a lamp behind your shoulder has a
                      negative one. Left in, the corners project
                      through infinity and what lands on the screen is
                      a white bowtie across the whole frame, which is
                      exactly what the first build of it did.
     THE WORLD        one sight line from the eye to the lamp — the
                      same call a trooper uses to decide whether it can
                      see you — so a wall, a shut door or the shop
                      between you and the aircraft takes the flare
                      away.
     ITS OWN HULL     and this is the one that is actually about an
                      aircraft. The lamp hangs under the NOSE, so the
                      fuselage is between you and it from above and
                      from behind, which is most of the sky the thing
                      flies in. The hull is a box in the aircraft's own
                      frame and the sight line is walked against it, so
                      the flare goes out as it banks over the top of
                      you and comes back as it rolls out.

   None of the three is a hard switch. A flare that pops off at a wall
   edge is worse than one that is a few frames late, so what the tests
   decide is a TARGET and the flare eases onto it — see Flare.render.

   AND IT CAN BE SHOT DOWN, at the user's request. Three shootable
   cylinders ride under it at its altitude (AIRBODY in js/states.js),
   each pointing back here, so the minigun's pitched rounds land on it
   the way they land on a van. Enough of them and it GOES UP, EPICALLY:
   a bang in the air, a dozen fireballs, a cloud of sparks, pieces of
   the aircraft's own skin thrown off it (the vehicles' Chunk, cut
   from this model), and then THE TAIL SPIN — it is still flying, on
   fire, the yaw winding up, the nose going down, the nacelles thrown
   to nothing, trailing flame and smoke and popping as it falls, until
   the lowest corner of it meets the ground and it goes up again on
   the tarmac, bigger, with a pool of fire under it and more pieces,
   and lies there charred and smouldering for the rest of the night.

   WHEN IT COMES: with the army. The tic the army is called, the first
   is ordered and arrives from the far end of the road eight seconds
   later, high, and comes down over the lot; when one is lost the next
   is fifty seconds behind it; and once the army's own curve has
   doubled twice there are two of them. See Gunships at the bottom.

   Positions are GAME coordinates (x, y across the map, z up) in the
   simulation and three's (x, z, -y) in the meshes, like everything
   else. The model's own axes — glTF's +Z nose, +Y up, +X left — go
   through the same swap the vans do (see js/car.js), so a part's
   local frame here is x forward, y up, z to the RIGHT.
