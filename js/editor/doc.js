/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — THE EDITOR'S MAP, AS A DOCUMENT
   =====================================================================

   What the editor edits, and what it hands the game. At the user's
   request the game has an editor now — SLADE and Ultimate Doom Builder
   are the workflow it is modelled on — and this file is the part of it
   that has no screen: the map as plain JSON, the undo stack over it,
   and the COMPILER that turns it into a Level the engine runs exactly as
   it runs the grid and the superstore.

   THE MODEL IS DOOM'S, WHERE DOOM'S IS RIGHT. A map is VERTICES, and
   SECTORS that are rings of vertex indices, and THINGS standing on
   them. A vertex two sectors share is ONE vertex: drag it and both
   sectors move, which is the whole of what makes vertex editing in a
   Doom editor feel like editing a building rather than a pile of
   polygons. Lines are not stored — a line is two consecutive vertices
   of a sector, and two sectors that run the same pair in opposite
   directions share it, which is what MapBuilder calls a doorway. What
   a line CAN carry (blocking, its own textures) is kept in `lines`,
   keyed by the pair.

   AND IT IS NOT DOOM'S WHERE THIS ENGINE IS MORE. Doom had one floor
   and one ceiling a sector, flat, and no objects that were not
   sprites. This engine has:

     STOREYS   a sector may have rooms stacked over it — a column, in
               js/level.js — so a building can have an upstairs
     SLOPES    a floor or a ceiling may TILT, as a plane through the
               middle of the sector
               (both of these are SWITCHED OFF for now, at the user's
               request — see FEATURES below; the compiler still knows
               how, and ignores them while the switch is off)
     PROPS     free boxes anywhere in 3D, with a bottom and a top that
               have nothing to do with any floor — the engine's
               `level.props`, the same thing the superstore's shelving
               details were drawn with

   so the document has those too, and the 3D view edits them.

   THE COMPILER does the two things a Doom editor does for you that
   this engine's MapBuilder does not:

     T-JUNCTIONS   MapBuilder welds two sectors into a doorway only
                   where they share BOTH ends of an edge. A room drawn
                   against half of a long wall shares a piece of that
                   wall and neither end of it, and would silently not be
                   joined. So every edge is split at every vertex that
                   lies on it, before MapBuilder sees it — which is what
                   js/maps/rectmap.js does for rectangles, done for any
                   shape.

     HOLES         a sector drawn entirely inside another — a pillar, a
                   pit, a raised platform — is, in Doom, simply a
                   sector with lines round it. Here a sector is one
                   ring of points and cannot have an island in it. So
                   the outer ring is BRIDGED to each inner one by a slit
                   of zero width: out along the bridge, round the
                   inside the other way, and back. The slit's two sides
                   weld to each other as a line with the same sector on
                   both sides — no wall, nothing to draw, nothing in the
                   way — and the point-in-polygon test the engine uses
                   is even-odd, so the hole is outside the outer sector
                   exactly as it should be.

   Nothing here touches the DOM, so tools/smoke-test.mjs compiles maps
   headless and holds them against the engine.
