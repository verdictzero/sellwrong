/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — turning a floor plan into triangles
   =====================================================================

   A two-sided line is a hole between two sectors, and what you actually
   SEE at that hole is the bit of wall above it and the bit of wall below
   it. Above: the gap between the two ceilings. Below: the gap between the
   two floors. Doom called them the upper and lower textures and every
   piece of level architecture in this game is one of them —

     a doorway      upper only, lower zero
     a shop counter lower only, 40 tall, shoot over it
     a kerb         lower, 8 tall, walk over it without noticing
     a window       upper AND lower, with the gap between them the glass
     a door         upper on a sector whose ceiling is on the floor

   PEGGING is the part everyone forgets and then wonders why their door
   looks wrong. When a sector moves, the wall above it changes height —
   so does the texture on it slide with the sector, or stay nailed to the
   fixed ceiling above? Doom answered with a flag; this answers with two
   named fields, because "pegUpper: 'bottom'" is a sentence and
   "flags |= 0x0008" is a lookup.

   The default is 'bottom', which nails the texture to the MOVING edge, so
   a door's face slides up with the door instead of scrolling past it.
   That is the default precisely because doors are the common case, and
   the common case should need no flag at all.

   BATCHING. Everything with the same texture goes into one buffer, so a
   whole supermarket is about twenty draw calls. Lighting is per-vertex
   and baked, so no lights, no shadows, and nothing to update.

   THE BLOCK IS THE UNIT OF DRAWING

   Everything with the same texture used to go into one buffer, so a
   whole supermarket was about twenty draw calls and every one of them
   had a bounding sphere the size of the store. That is fine for a store
   and it is nothing at all for a town: a batch whose bounds are the
   entire town is never culled, so every brick wall in it is submitted
   every frame whichever way you are facing.

   So a batch is one texture IN ONE BLOCK. Twenty-five blocks by twenty
   textures is more draw calls than twenty — and it is the only way the
   frustum means anything, and it is what lets the portal flood turn a
   block off outright (see applyVisibility below, and SIGHT.txt). It is
   also what makes the char rebuild affordable: when a region finishes
   burning, the block it is in is rebuilt and the other twenty-four are
   left alone.

   The grid is the town's own block pitch, anchored at the world origin,

  /* AND WHO ANSWERS FOR A BLOCK, which is not the same question as what
     is drawn in it, and the difference was a real hole.

     applyVisibility asks a block whether any REGION in it is visible. A
     region is in the block its middle lands in; a line is in the block
     its MIDPOINT lands in. Those two are usually the same block and
     occasionally are not — and the case where they are not is the one
     that matters, because it is a big outdoor region owning the wall of
     the building it wraps round. The wood behind the west wing is nine
     thousand units of forest whose middle is a block and a half away
     from the supermarket's flank, and that flank is the wood's own
     one-sided wall: its geometry lands in the anchor's block, whose
     visibility is answered entirely by the anchor's aisles.

     So the whole west side of the building was drawn only because the
     portal flood leaked through the fire doors into the shop. Shut the
     doors to sight — which is what a steel leaf does — and the building
     loses its outside. Found by giving the fire exits the staff door's
     `opaque`, and it had been true since the day blocks were introduced.

     The fix is to let a line's OWNERS answer for the block its geometry
     went into, as well as the regions centred there. Nothing moves: the
     triangles stay where they are, so a block is still rebuilt on its
     own and still culled by its own corner. */

     TWO THINGS DECIDE WHETHER A BATCH IS DRAWN, AND BOTH ARE ABOUT SIZE

     The town is twenty-five blocks and every block is about thirty
     textures, so the frustum alone submits eight hundred draw calls
     down a street — and measured on a street, two thirds of them
     carried sixty-four triangles or fewer and half of THOSE were
     further away than seven thousand units. A two-triangle strip of
     road line, in its own draw call, five kilometres off.

     THE AIR HAS ALREADY HIDDEN THE FAR ONES. Every surface in the game
     is mixed toward a texel of the sky by its distance (worldShade in
     js/material.js), and the mix is nearly complete well before the
     air's own far limit: at eighty-five per cent of airFar a surface is
     ninety-three per cent sky. What is drawn there is the sky with a
     four per cent memory of a roof in it, and not drawing it leaves the
     sky, which is the same picture. So a block past FAR_AIR of the
     current air is not submitted. It follows the weather for free —
     rain pulls airFar in to five thousand and the town closes up with
     it, which is what a town in the rain does.

     AND A BATCH TOO SMALL TO SEE IS NOT WORTH A DRAW CALL. Each one
     knows how much WORLD it covers (see Batch.tri), so its share of the
     screen is that over the square of the distance, and below a few
     pixels of it there is nothing there to draw. Area and not triangle
     count, because a road is two triangles and an acre, and area and

   THE ROOF IS NOT A SECTOR

   A sector engine cannot slope a ceiling, and a flat-roofed house is not
   an American house. So a pitched roof is GEOMETRY, generated from the
   building's footprint and pushed into the same BatchSet as everything
   else: two sloped planes and two gable triangles. There is precedent
   for this in the project and it is load-bearing — roofFraming in
   js/ruin.js puts a steel frame over a burnt-out region without any
   sector knowing, and the logo over the entrance is geometry for the
   same reason.

   You never get on a roof. It does not need to be walkable. It needs to
   be a SILHOUETTE, and from the far end of a street the silhouette is
   the entire difference between a town and a row of boxes.

   A sector carries the whole building's roof, not its own share of one:
   `s.roof = { x0, y0, x1, y1, base, rise, tex, gableTex, along }`, where

     AND THE UNDERSIDE, for a roof that has nothing under it.

     A roof is ONE-SIDED, like every other surface this file makes: the
     slopes face out and the gables face out, and from underneath a roof
     is not there at all. That is right for every roof over a room —
     what is under it is a ceiling, and you see the ceiling — and it is
     wrong for exactly one thing in the game, which is the CHURCH SPIRE.
     The spire stands on the tower's cornice over a storey that is SHUT,
     so there is no ceiling under it; stand in the churchyard and look up
     at the steeple and you see straight through it into the sky, which
     is what the user reported.

     So a roof may say what its underside is made of, and gets a flat
     cap at its springing, facing DOWN — a boxed soffit, which is what a
     real steeple has and is where a real one stops. Wound the other way
     round from a floor, for the reason set out in addFlats: a surface

   A BOX THAT BELONGS TO NO SECTOR

   A sector engine can do a great many things and there are three it
   cannot do at all: it cannot put anything ABOVE a roof, it cannot put
   anything in FRONT of a wall without carving the ground in front of
   that wall into pieces, and it cannot have two things at the same x,y
   unless one is above the other in the same column. Which rules out, in
   order of how much a town misses them: the chimney, the porch, the
   cornice, the dormer, the downpipe and the shed.

   A ROOF ALREADY HAD THIS PROBLEM and already has the answer — see
   roofGeometry, and `level.roofs`, which is a list of footprints drawn
   as free triangles and owned by no region. This is the same bargain
   for a box: six faces at a place, batched into the block it stands in,
   rebuilt when that block is, lit by a number the map hands over.

   WHAT IT COSTS is what a roof costs: it is not a region, so it is not
   in the portal flood, it holds no fuel, nothing walks on it and
   nothing collides with it. So a box goes ABOVE HEAD HEIGHT or it goes
   flat against a wall you could not walk through anyway, and anything
   that has to stop you is still a sector. Every one of them in this
   town obeys that: see the props in js/maps/town.js.

   THE WINDING, which is the whole of the work. The map's y is the
   renderer's minus z, so a ring that is counter-clockwise on the floor
   plan is clockwise on the screen and every face in this file is wound
   against the plan to compensate (see the long note in addQuad). For a
   box that comes out as: walk the four sides counter-clockwise on the
   plan — south, east, north, west — and wind each one the way addQuad
   winds a line's FRONT, and every face looks out. The lid is the ring
   itself, in plan order, which is what addFlats does for a floor.

   THE STREET LAMP IS GEOMETRY

   It was a sprite: an acorn globe on a post, drawn by js/sprites.js,
   fullbright, turned to face you like every other thing in the game.
   It is a PHOTOGRAPH now — a cobra-head road light on a tapered pole,
   cut out of its chroma key by tools/bake-art.mjs — and a photograph of
   a lamp post cannot be a sprite. A sprite turns to face the camera
   plane, and this picture is a pole with a bracket arm reaching out on
   one side of it: as a sprite, the arm would swing round to point at
   you wherever you stood, and a street of them would be a street of
   lamps all pointing at the player.

   So it is a FLAT CUT-OUT, stood in the world at a fixed angle: two
   masked quads (the head tile and the post tile, see STREET_LAMP in
   js/textures.js) in the vertical plane ACROSS the street, the foot of
   the picture on the thing's own x,y and the arm reaching the way the
   thing's angle says, which the town sets toward the road. Walk down
   the street and every lamp on it shows you its profile with its head
   out over the carriageway; stand under one and look across the road
   and it is edge-on, a line, which is what a lamp post is edge-on.
   Both faces are drawn, and — unlike a fence, whose two faces each
   read left to right from their own side — both faces put the SAME u
   at the same point in the world, so the arm reaches over the road
   from whichever side you see it. Seen from behind, the picture is its
   own mirror image, and a lamp post is not chiral.

   It is not on a line. Everything else this file draws is a surface of
   a sector or the boundary between two, and a lamp standing in the
   middle of a pavement is neither; it is a thing, like a headstone,
   and the map lays it as one. The actor is still there for its radius
   (ACTORS.STREETLAMP, which has no sprite any more); this is what you
   see. It goes in the block's SHELL, with the roofs, because a lamp is
   what you read a street by from the far end of it.

   ITS LIGHT IS TWO OTHER THINGS. The pool on the pavement is a sector
   the town lays (walkRun in js/maps/town.js) and this file marks as
   lamp-lit so the shader can turn it cold after dark; the lamp's own
   post is marked the same, being lit by its own light. The flare at
   the luminaire — the point of light and the streak across it that a
   lamp actually is from across a street at night — is js/lamplight.js,
   and hangs on STREET_LAMP.lens.

   A WALL WITH A HOLE IN IT IS SEVERAL WALLS

   addQuad already knew how to draw PART of a line — `span`, which was
   put in so that the wall under a gable could be drawn in the two
   pieces either side of the ridge, with the texture still reading as
   one length of brick across both. A hole is that same idea in two
   axes, and it needs nothing new from this file except the decision to
   ask.

   So this is the wrapper: if the line has anything missing (see
   js/breach.js), draw the pieces that survive instead of the whole
   band, each with its own span and its own height, and the u it wears
   still runs from the line's own start — so a hole punched through the
   middle of a shopfront leaves the brick either side of it lined up
   with the brick above and below.

   ONLY FLAT BANDS. A band with a sloped end is an interval that changes
   along the line, and cutting a rectangle out of a trapezoid is a
   different piece of arithmetic for the sake of the gables and the
   roof soffits — which are the highest surfaces in the game and the
   ones a beam is least often pointed at. A sloped band takes the hit
   and stays whole; everything at head height does not slope.
