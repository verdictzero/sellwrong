/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the car park, and what happens to it
   =====================================================================

   js/car.js reads a GLB off the disk and hands back its triangles. This
   is what those triangles DO: stand in a bay, catch, go up, leave the
   ground, come down on the roof, go up again, and lie there burning
   while the pieces of it smoulder on the tarmac around it.

   ONE MESH UNTIL SOMETHING MOVES. There are seventy-seven bays and
   every one of them is filled, and seventy-seven meshes is seventy-seven
   draw calls for a row of things that never move. So a parked car is not
   a mesh: it is a slab of vertices baked into world space and
   concatenated into ONE geometry, the same bargain js/mapgeo.js makes
   with the walls. A car only gets a mesh of its own for the second and a
   half it is in the air; when it lands it is baked into a second slab
   with the other wrecks, and so is every piece of debris that has come
   to rest. Rebuilds happen once at the end of whichever tic dirtied
   them, so a chain reaction that takes out six cars rebuilds once, and
   nothing is ever drawn twice in one frame.

   THE TUMBLE IS NOT A PHYSICS ENGINE and does not want to be. It is
   Doom's own arithmetic — a velocity, a gravity of 0.85 units per tic
   per tic, which is the same fall the sparks off a broken light take,
   and which happens to be very close to a real g at this world's scale.
   Three spin rates are integrated separately as Euler angles in the
   order the mesh is built for (see carMesh): yaw, then roll about the
   car's own length, then pitch nose over tail. That is not rigid-body
   dynamics and for a car in the air for forty tics nobody can tell.

   IT LANDS ON ITS ROOF BECAUSE THE ROLL RATE IS CHOSEN SO IT WILL. The
   flight is ballistic, so the time it will be in the air is known the
   moment it leaves the ground — a box turned half a turn about its long
   axis is exactly as tall as it was, so the centre comes back to the
   height it started at, and the flight lasts 2v/g. Divide half a turn by
   that and the car completes its roll as it arrives. It is aimed, not
   simulated, and it is the difference between a car that lands upside
   down and a car that lands upside down SOMETIMES.

   HOW HIGH A CAR ON ITS ROOF SITS is not a number anybody types in. The
   eight corners of its own box get turned by whatever orientation it has
   at that moment, and the lowest one is put on the tarmac. Which means
   it works at any angle, so the settle — the ten tics where it rocks
   from however it hit onto its roof — is just the same test run every
   tic while the orientation eases to its resting one.

   THE PAINT

   ONE MODEL, ONE SHEET, ONE DRAW CALL, AND A CAR PARK THAT IS NOT ALL
   THE SAME COLOUR. The whole lot is a single mesh — seventy-seven
   vehicles in one geometry, which is the thing worth keeping — so a red
   van cannot be a different file or a different texture. It is the same
   texel multiplied by a colour that rides in the vertices, in the ink
   channel that was already there and was saying nothing (see the INK
   block in js/material.js, which is where the white paint is isolated
   and where this is spent).

   WHAT THE COLOURS ARE. A supermarket car park in a town where half the
   population has already left, so: the white the model came in, a
   couple of dirty near-whites and silvers, and then the browns, tans,
   greens, maroons and blues that a fifteen-year-old panel van is
   actually painted. Nothing bright — a lot full of primary colours
   reads as a toy box, and this one has to read as somewhere people
   parked to go and buy bread. The saturated ones are the exceptions
   they are in a real car park: one red, one blue, one yellow.

   AND THEY ARE ALL BRIGHTER THAN THEY LOOK ON PAPER, because this
   multiplies TWICE. The sheet's own shading is in the texel already,
   and then the car park's light — which is dusk, in a town where the
   power is going — is on top of that. The first cut of this palette was
   picked at the values a van is actually painted, 0.24 to 0.6, and the
   lot came out as two whites and ten grey shapes with wheels. Nothing
   under about 0.4 in its strongest channel survives to the screen.
   ===================================================================== */
/* AND THE QUIET ONES ARE IN IT TWICE, which is the whole of the
   weighting: a real car park is mostly white, silver and beige with a

     for the next five to seven seconds two of its attributes are wound
     by hand: `charred`, which js/material.js scatters live coals over
     in proportion, and `light`, which comes down to a third so the
     paint goes black under them. The soot is the same coals and the
     same dark that a wreck ends up with; a charring car is a wreck
     arriving gradually, and when it reaches the end it goes up on the
     geometry it has, so what is in the air is the black thing you
     watched turn black.

     Off it the whole time: sparks, more of them as it goes; smoke,
     thicker; and the one fire light pulled toward it, harder as it
     goes, so the bay around a car about to go is lit like a hearth.

   ONE THAT DRIVES

   The police van, which is the first vehicle in the game with somewhere
   to go. It is an ordinary Vehicle in the ways that matter — three
   cylinders, its own mesh, the same box — with one state in front of
   `parked` that nothing else has: DRIVING, along a list of points the
   map hands out (see level.swatRoutes), at a speed, with its three
   blockers carried along under it.

   AND IT BURNS, at the user's request, which it did not for a while:
   it was FIREPROOF, which for a vehicle is invulnerable, and the reason
   was that going up was what used to stop it unloading. It is now
   ARMOURED instead — fireArmour and charFuse in Vehicle — so the stream
   ends one in most of a minute where it ends a hatchback in nine
   seconds. Hold it on one and you get the bay back; wave it past and
   you have wasted your tank. The crew that is already out does not care
   either way, and the troopers themselves are still fireproof.

   AND IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A CAR PHYSICS NOW, at the user's request.
   The position still rides the polyline exactly — there is no grip, no
   slip and no mass — but the SPEED along it is integrated rather than
   assumed, and the body is hung off it:

     it builds up to speed from a standing start, and it brakes for the
     END of the route rather than for the next corner, on the oldest
     trick in the book: the fastest it may be going is the speed from
     which it could still stop in the distance it has left. So it comes
     off the road already slowing and rolls the last two lengths into
     its place rather than arriving at speed and switching off

     and the body DIPS when it does that. A damped spring on the pitch,
     driven by the acceleration, so the nose goes down under braking,
     the tail squats under power, and when it stops the whole thing
     rocks back once and settles. A second spring on the roll, driven by
     how hard it is turning, leans it out of a corner. Neither of them
     is simulated from a suspension: they are the acceleration, read
     twice, through a spring that overshoots. It costs four numbers and
     it is the difference between a model sliding along a line and a van
     pulling up.

   It stops where the route ends, squares up along the front, and is a
   parked van from then on — the responders decide what comes out of it.

   AND IT DOES NOT STOP FOR ANYBODY. The lot is full of people running
   from a fire, and a squad van coming up the frontage lane at speed
   goes through them: anything solid in front of it is hit hard enough
   to come apart, and the player is shoved and hurt, which is the one
   thing other than a rifle that gets through their fireproofing.
   ===================================================================== */
/* AT THE USER'S REQUEST THEY SPEED IN, and this is the third number it
   has been. Fifteen units a tic — twice a running shopper — put the
   first van in front of you half a minute after it was called, which is
   an interval rather than a response. Thirty was a van with its lights
   on at two in the morning, and took fourteen seconds, and the user
   said it was still too slow.

   SIXTY IS NOT A VAN ANY MORE and is not meant to be: it is two
   thousand units a second, which against a running shopper's four is
   something arriving rather than something driving. What the number
   actually buys is the OUTSIDE case — see `runIn` and `stop` in
   js/responders.js, which are the other two thirds of the same request:
   step out of the building and the first convoy is at the junction
   within a second, across the lot in three, and stopped a van's nose
   from you rather than a van's length.

   AND THE HEADING KEEPS UP, which is the one thing the speed can break.
   The POSITION rides the polyline exactly whatever the speed is; it is
   the drawn yaw that eases, and at thirty units a tic 0.09 a tic was
   enough to be square through a corner.

   AND THEN THE USER SAID SLOWER, which is the fourth number and this
   one: THIRTY-SIX, and it is a top speed now rather than a constant, so
   the average over an approach is well under it. What pays for the
   slowness is the distance — they come into being just out of sight
   rather than at the junction (see `runIn` in js/responders.js) — so
   the clock from the trigger barely moves and what you see is a vehicle
   driving rather than a vehicle teleporting.

/* THE BODY ON TWO SPRINGS, which is the whole of the weight shift and
   is not a suspension: it is the acceleration, read twice, through
   something that overshoots.

   `pitchPerG` turns acceleration into a target angle — negative when
   braking, which is nose down, because the mesh's own +Z rotation
   raises the nose (see carMesh, which orders the Euler YXZ so that
   pitch and roll are in the vehicle's own frame). `rollPerG` does the
   same for how hard it is turning, and leans the body OUT of the bend
   the way a real one does, because it is the outside springs that
   compress.

   BOTH ARE ON THE INSTANCE AND BOTH CAN BE NEGATIVE, which is the whole
   of what makes a hover carrier a different vehicle rather than a
   recoloured one. A thing on springs leans out of a bend and dips its
   nose to stop; a thing on thrust does the opposite of both, because
   what it is doing is pointing its lift somewhere else. The APC takes
   the same two lines of code with the signs turned over. See ArmyApc.

   SPRING and DAMP are what make it read as weight rather than as a
   tilt. Undamped it wobbles for ever; critically damped it slides into

/* =====================================================================
   AND ONE THAT DOES NOT TOUCH THE ROAD

   The army's APC, which is the second thing that drives up the road and
   the first that does not drive on it. It is a SwatVan in every way
   that is about GETTING somewhere — the same polyline, the same eased
   heading, the same nose that goes through whatever is in front of it,
   the same doors — because a hover carrier coming up a frontage lane
   takes the same corners a van does, and every one of those corners is
   already measured against this map. What is different is everything
   about what it IS.

   IT FLOATS, AND IT NEVER HOLDS STILL. `hover` holds the whole vehicle
   off the tarmac and the BOB breathes it up and down, which is the
   entire trick: nothing else in this game moves when it is standing
   still, so a thing that does reads as held up by something rather than
   parked. The gap under it is not a gap you can use — the blockers are
   as tall as the hover plus the hull and they still stand ON the ground
   (see Vehicle.block), because an APC's skirts are in the way whether
   they are touching or not.

   THE BOB IS TWO SINES, not one, on periods that do not divide into one
   another: a four-second breath with a ten-second swell under it. One
   sine on its own is a metronome and the eye finds it in about three
   cycles; two is a thing being held up by something that is not quite
   managing it. And it is BIGGER WHEN IT IS PARKED — a little over half
   as much while it is moving — because a hovercraft at speed is held
   steadier by the ground under it and one standing still wallows, and
   because what the user asked for was the bob you see when it has
   stopped.

   AND IT IS NEVER LEVEL. Two more slow sines, on two more periods, put
   a degree or so of pitch and a degree and a half of roll into it and
   take them out again — see restPitch and restRoll, which is where the
   springs in SwatVan are told what "at rest" means. A parked van's
   springs settle and then cost nothing for the rest of the night; a
   parked APC's are never asleep, because what they are settling onto
   keeps moving.

   AND IT BANKS INTO ITS TURNS, AND PITCHES UP TO STOP. Which is the
   same two lines of SwatVan's suspension with both signs turned over,
   and it is turned over for a reason rather than for the look. A thing
   on springs leans OUT of a bend because the outside springs compress,
   and dips its nose to brake because the weight goes forward. A thing
   on THRUST has no springs and no weight to move: to turn it points its
   lift into the bend, and to stop it points its lift forward, so it
   banks in and it pitches nose-up. Twice the van's lean at nearly three
   times the coefficient, because a carrier heeling over into the
   frontage lane is the whole reason anybody draws one of these.

   The angles are capped where they are because of the ground: at seven
   degrees of pitch the nose drops fifteen units and at ten degrees of
   bank the low flank drops eleven, against thirty-four of hover with
   seven of bob in it. It leans as far as it can lean without putting a
   corner through the tarmac, and no further.

   AND IT BLOWS THE CAR PARK ABOUT. Whatever holds it up throws grit
   down, so there is a puff under the middle of it every few tics — hard
   and low while it is moving, an idle while it stands. This is the one
   piece of it that is not free and it is worth what it costs: it is
   what makes the hover read at a distance, where five units of bob is
   nothing.

   AND IT WEIGHS MORE. Twice the van's damage to anybody in front of it
   and half again to you, which for a vehicle this wide is most of the
   fire lane at once.

   IT DOES NOT HAVE A SIREN. Two notes still, on the same clock, but
   they are the turbine: a low sawtooth that rises and falls instead of
   a square wave that wails. See `hover` and `hover2` in js/audio.js.

   AND ONE THAT COMES FOR THE FIRE

   The fire brigade's truck, at the user's request: the police van
   repainted red with a water cannon on its roof, and the first thing in
   the game that is on the side of the building. It is a SwatVan in
   everything about getting somewhere — the same road, the same ring, the
   same stands (see js/brigade.js for where it is sent) — and a different
   vehicle once it has stopped: nobody gets out of it (yet), and the
   cannon goes to work.

   THE CANNON LOOKS, TURNS, AND POURS. Every CANNON_LOOK tics it picks the
   fire it will play on — a burning vehicle first, because those go up;
   then a person alight; then the nearest part of the store's fire or the
   wood's it can see from the nozzle and reach — and the turret slews
   toward it at CANNON_TURN a tic, the barrel lifting to the angle that
   lands a jet there (aimPitch in js/water.js integrates the jet's own
   flight). Once it is on, it pours, and it walks the jet a little either
   side while it does, the way a crew plays a monitor over a fire rather
   than drilling one point of it. With nothing left to put out the turret
   comes back to face the front.

   IT STANDS IN THE FIRE and takes a long time about burning: three times
   the squad van's fire armour and half again its fuse. A fire truck that
   can be lit by the fire it came to is fair; one that goes up the moment
   it parks is not a fire truck.

   * genuinely in a bay rather than near one. The lot is only about
   * two-fifths full and thins towards the road, because half the town
   * has already left; that is the map's decision and this just fills
   * what it was given.
   *
   * ONE VAN, SEVENTY-SEVEN TIMES, at the user's request. It used to be
   * five civilian bodies picked off the slot's own `variant`, built out
   * of boxes and painted by projecting four drawings onto them; it is
   * now assets/models/van.glb in every bay, drawn as its author exported
   * it. What that costs is variety, and what it buys is a car park full
   * of the user's own model — and, read a certain way, a delivery fleet
   * parked outside a store called SellWrong is not the wrong joke.
   *
   * `variant` is still on every slot and is still what would pick
   * between vehicles if there were more than one; it is simply not read
   * while there is one. The drawn fleet's riot van and APC are still
   * measured and still packed in their atlas, waiting for
   * js/responders.js to drive them up the road.
   *
   * BUT THEY ARE NOT ALL THE SAME COLOUR ANY MORE, at the user's
   * request. One model in seventy-seven bays is a delivery fleet, which
   * was a joke worth one look; a car park is what this is meant to be,
   * and a car park is twelve colours of the same shape. The paint rides
   * in the vertices and the white in the sheet is isolated in the
   * shader — see PAINT above, and the INK block in js/material.js — so
   * it is still one texture and still one draw call.
