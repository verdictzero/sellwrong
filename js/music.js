   THREE TRACKS, at the user's request, and they play for ever: the
   user's three E1M1 remixes (four files arrived; two of them were the
   same file byte for byte, so there are three), one into the next into
   the next and round again, each fading into the one after it on the
   beat.

   BEAT AWARE, AND PRE-ARRANGED. Nothing is analysed while the game
   runs. Each track was measured once, offline, in the same decoder the
   browser uses — tempo to a hundredth of a beat a minute, the downbeat
   at the head, and a downbeat in the last forty seconds to hand over
   on — and the answers are the table below. What the player does at
   run time is arithmetic on that table.

   THE HANDOVER, which is the whole design:

     the outgoing track reaches `out`, a downbeat eight bars or so
     before its own ending. On that instant the incoming track's first
     downbeat lands — it was started `bar0` seconds earlier, scaled —
     and both gains ramp LINEARLY over FADE_BARS bars of the outgoing
     tempo, one up and one down, and the outgoing stops.

     AND THE INCOMING ARRIVES AT THE OUTGOING'S TEMPO. The three are
     not the same speed — 145.8, 140.3 and 142.3 — and a fade between
     two grids four per cent apart flams by a quarter of a beat before
     it is half done. So the incoming starts with its playback rate
     set to the ratio, so that its bars are the outgoing's bars for as
     long as both can be heard, and then over MATCH_BARS more bars the
     rate ramps linearly back to one, which is a DJ's pitch fader
     being eased home once the other deck is off. Four per cent of
     pitch for a few seconds, once every four minutes, under a mix.

   All of that is Web Audio's own clock: sources started at a time,
   gains and rates ramped to a time, sample accurate whatever the frame
   rate is doing. tick() only has to look a few seconds ahead and put
   the next handover on the schedule before it is due.

   IT HAS ITS OWN CONTEXT rather than the sound effects', because the
   effects are switched off behind MUTED in js/audio.js and the music
   is not, and because a decoded four-minute track is thirty megabytes
   of floats the effects never need to know about.

   The arithmetic is exported on its own so the smoke test can hold a
   handover against the table without a speaker.
