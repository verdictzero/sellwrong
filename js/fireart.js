   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the fire, drawn
   =====================================================================

   Every flame in the game comes out of this file: the fire on a shelf,
   the blaze a whole gondola turns into, the embers left on the floor
   afterwards, the fire climbing a fir, the pilot light on the gun and
   the flash at the muzzle. One generator, four sizes, so all of it is
   visibly the same fire.

   IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE'S ART UNTIL NOW. Four twenty-frame painted strips
   from the golf project, run through a tool that tried to round off
   their feet with a mask. That is what this replaces, and the reason is
   worth writing down, because it is the whole design of what is here:

     A MASK CANNOT ROUND A BOTTOM. The painted flames were drawn standing
     on the ground, so the widest, brightest row of every frame is its
     LAST row — a hard horizontal edge. A mask can pinch that row in from
     the sides, and the old tool did, but every surviving column still
     ENDS ON THE SAME ROW. Narrowing a flat edge leaves a narrower flat
     edge. To curve the bottom you have to lift the flame's foot per
     column, and once you are deciding where every column ends you are no
     longer masking a picture, you are drawing one.

   SO IT IS DRAWN, AND THE ROUND BOTTOM IS THE FIRST THING DRAWN. The
   flame is a chain of circles: a BALL at the foot, then a column of
   smaller and smaller circles up to a point. The bottom of the shape is
   the bottom of that ball, which is round because a circle is. There is
   no row where the flame stops; there is a curve where it stops, and
   nothing about the way it is made could have produced a flat edge. That
   is what a fire hanging in the air off a burning branch needs — it
   reads as sitting ON something from any angle, without the engine
   having to know what it is sitting on.

   FOUR MORE THINGS MAKE IT A FIRE RATHER THAN A LAVA LAMP:

     THE LICK. The chain of circles does not run straight up. Its axis
     sways, anchored at the foot and loosest at the tip, so the flame
     leans and whips instead of standing there pulsing.

     THE BITE. A noise field scrolling upward eats into the edge of that
     shape and pushes tongues out of it — hardly at all down at the ball,
     where the fuel is, and hard at the top, where a flame is coming
     apart into separate licks. This is what stops the silhouette from
     looking like a balloon.

     THE STREAKS. A second noise field, finer and climbing twice as
     fast, which never touches the silhouette and only decides how hot
     each pixel inside it is. Without it the brightness falls off in a
     smooth gradient and the thing reads as a glowing egg with tongues
     on top, however good the outline is.

     THE HEAT. White at the foot, through the fire ramp's whole route to
     a dull red at the tip and at every edge. Most of a flame is the dull
     end; the white heat is a few pixels at the base. That is the shape
     of the painted strips too, which is the one thing about them worth
     keeping, and it is why palette.js gives fire forty-four entries —
     but it is spent on EIGHT BANDS rather than a smooth ramp, because
     forty-four smooth steps give an airbrushed blob and eight give the
     contour bands a painted flame has, with the streaks deciding where
     they fall.

   AND IT LOOPS EXACTLY. The old generator was the PSX Doom fire routine
   — seed the bottom row, cool and shift each row from the one below —
   which is a simulation, and a simulation cannot be made to come back to
   where it started. It popped once a loop, for ever, on every fire on
   screen. The noise here REPEATS: the lattice wraps after a whole number
   of rows and the scroll over `count` frames is exactly that distance,
   so the last frame hands over to the first with nothing moving. A fire
   is on screen from the moment you light it until the building falls
   down, which is long enough for a pop every second to be the thing
   people notice about it.

   NOTHING IS SNAPPED, because there is nothing to snap: every colour
   here comes out of `ramp('fire', t)` and is already one of the game's
   256. Running snap() over it would only cost the soft edge, which the
   additive flames on the trees want and the alpha-tested ones in the
   store throw away by themselves.

   TWENTY IS NOT DECORATION. The pattern has to climb the sprite at a
   believable rate AND get back to where it started at the end, so the
   distance it travels in a loop is fixed by the frame count: fewer
   frames means bigger jumps between them, and a fire that steps four
   pixels a frame reads as a strobe. Twenty is where it stops looking
   stepped. The embers get fewer because they barely move.
