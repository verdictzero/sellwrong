   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — who comes when a supermarket is on fire at 2am
   =====================================================================

   THE SWAT COME, and they are the first thing in the game that fights
   back. The rest of this file is still the shape it was — an alarm that
   only climbs, six tiers that are dispatched at a threshold and arrive
   after a drive — and that shape is kept, because the night manager and
   the fire brigade are still coming one day and the escalation is
   already written and tested. What is new is underneath it: one squad,
   on its own trigger, that does not wait for the alarm.

   WHAT CALLS THEM IS THE TRIGGER, at the user's request. Not the fire —
   a supermarket alight is the fire brigade's business — but the first
   shot out of any weapon, on the tic you fire it, which in this game is
   the first thing anybody does. It used to be the first KILL and a
   sixteen-second wait on top, which together read as the game giving
   you a head start; now there is no head start and the sirens are the
   answer to the flamethrower rather than to the body. THREE AT A TIME,
   at the user's request: where one van used to be sent,
   three are, nose to tail from the same end of the road, and the budget
   is three times what it was so that the second and third are not
   simply refused. They unload their crews one at a time and, when the
   crew is out, keep trickling for as long as they stand there, which is
   for ever, because a squad van is fireproof (see SwatVan) and nothing
   in the game ends one.

   AND THEY COME TO WHEREVER YOU ARE. Inside the building they pull up
   across the fire lane in front of the doors, which is what the fire
   lane is for and what the map's bays say. Anywhere else — the car
   park, the verge, the trees, round the back of the shop — the
   destination is YOU: the nearest point on the perimeter road to
   wherever you are standing, reached by walking the ring the short way
   round from the junction they came in at, and then off the road
   toward you for as far as the tarmac holds. In the middle of the lot
   that is a van pulling up two car lengths away with its side door
   facing you. Behind the building, where no road goes, it is a van on
   the frontage lane and a crew already walking. Hiding moves the fight;
   it does not end it.

   AND IT RAMPS EXPONENTIALLY, at the user's request, and the ramp is
   ONE NUMBER: the PRESSURE, 1 at the call and doubling every so many
   seconds from then on, without limit. Everything that says how much
   police there is — how many vans may be on the road or standing, how
   many troopers may be on their feet, how long between vans, how long
   between one trooper and the next out of a standing van — is a
   starting value times that number, read off the curve at the moment
   the question is asked rather than fixed at the call. So the same
   minute of the night is the same everywhere: the vans come twice as
   often, the doors open twice as often and twice as many are allowed
   out, all together. The floors under the gaps and the ceiling on the
   troopers are what the engine can carry, not the design; the design
   is the curve, and the curve does not stop.

   AND THEN THE ARMY COMES, at the user's request and in the order the
   user set: the SWAT, then the army, then a super army after them. The
   army is not a harder SWAT van, it is a SECOND FORCE — its own clock,
   its own budget, its own curve starting at 1 the moment it is called,
   its own carrier (the APC, which hovers; see ArmyApc in
   js/vehicles.js) and its own soldier (see ACTORS.ARMY). It is called
   at a PRESSURE rather than at a time — when the night is pressing
   eight times what it was at the first shot, which on the SWAT's own
   doubling clock is three minutes in — so the threshold is written in
   the same units as the escalation it is part of, and retuning the
   doubling moves the army with it rather than leaving it behind.

   WHAT THE TWO FORCES SHARE is everything about the MAP: the ring, the
   ways in, the bays, where a stand is and how a route reaches it. What
   they do not share is anything about themselves. So FORCES below is a
   row per force and the machinery underneath takes one as an argument;
   the super army is a third row and a sheet, and nothing else.

   AND THE FIRE LANE HAS NINE BAYS, which the curve asks past inside
   four minutes. When they are all full the next one stands along the
   ring by the doors instead of not coming, which is the same answer
   this file already gives for a player out in the car park — the ring
   is a place to stand anywhere on it, and running out of bays was the
   one way the escalation used to quietly stop.

   WHERE THEY GO is the map's business. level.swatRoutes is the way in
   from each end of the road and level.swatBays is where a van may stop,
   both worked out where the lot's own numbers are; this file joins one
   to the other and drives nothing itself. See SwatVan and ArmyApc in
   js/vehicles.js for the driving and js/states.js for the troops.

   THE SQUAD, IN NUMBERS

   `after` is the trigger pull that calls them — the first — and
   `firstDelay` is what used to be the drive from wherever they were
   and is now nothing: they are dispatched on the tic you fire.

   THEN THE CURVE. `doubling` is how often the pressure doubles, from
   the call; the four `at pressure 1` numbers are what the night starts
   at, and every one of them is divided or multiplied by the pressure
   as it is used (see pressure, vanCap, trooperCap, gapNow, trickleNow).
   A minute in: twice the vans allowed, twice the troopers, half the
   gap, half the trickle. Two minutes: four times. Three: eight. The
   floors and the ceiling are the engine's, and the bays are the map's;
   the curve reaches all of them inside four minutes and then simply
   holds the lot at what the engine will carry.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------- */
export const SWAT = {
  /* WHAT CALLS THEM IS THE TRIGGER, at the user's request: one shot out
     of any weapon, which is the first thing anybody does in this game.

     read as the game letting you start. */
  after: 1,                              // shots fired before anybody is called

  /* A SMIDGE LESS OF ALL OF IT, at the user's request, and the whole of
     the reduction is in this block and the four numbers below. It is a
     trim rather than a rewrite: nothing about WHEN the first convoy
     arrives has moved — that is the run-in and the speed, and the user
     asked for those and they stay — and neither has the size of a send.
     What has come down is how fast the night builds on top of it and
     how much of it the lot ever holds.

     The doubling is seventy seconds rather than sixty, so every step of
     the curve takes a sixth longer: two minutes in the night is
     pressing three and a third rather than four, three minutes six
     rather than eight. The ceilings come down a quarter. And the four
     starting values each lose one, which is the part that is felt in
     the first minute, when the curve has not multiplied anything yet.

     Measured standing still in the middle of the lot, never firing
     again, so nobody dies and the count is what the budget allows
     rather than what you let live:

                 was                    now
       1 min     11 troopers            9

       6 min     80 + 31 army           60 + 17

     The ceiling is sixty rather than eighty and arrives at five minutes
     rather than four. The army is untouched — it is the user's newest
     thing and there is not much of it — but it starts later anyway,
     because its trigger is a pressure on this curve and this curve now
     takes longer to get there: three and a half minutes rather than
     three. */

     `push` is how far off the road one will drive to reach you, `stop`
     is how close it parks, and `convoyGap` is how far back down the
     road the second and third of a send start, so they arrive as a
     line rather than inside one another.

     AND `stop` IS THREE HUNDRED, which is the third number it has been
     and the user's second thought about it. Two hundred and sixty was
     called too far away; a hundred and twenty put the nose thirteen
     units off your face, which is what "almost run into" asks for and
     turned out to be too much of it. Three hundred is to the MIDDLE of
     a van two hundred and fourteen long, so the nose stops about two
     hundred off — half a van, near enough to be in your way and far
     enough to be a van rather than a wall. Braking into it rather than
     stopping dead is the other half of why it reads differently now;
     see DRIVE_BRAKE in js/vehicles.js.

     AND `push` IS TWENTY-SIX HUNDRED, so that reaching you means
     crossing the lot rather than leaving the kerb. What stops one is
     the tarmac running out, not the budget: the walk toward you gives
     up the moment the ground is not drivable, so the number only ever
     buys distance over ground a van could really cross. */
  stand: 560,
  push: 2600,
  stop: 300,

  /* AND WHERE THEY COME FROM WHEN YOU ARE OUTSIDE, which is the other
     half of "as rapidly as possible". The map's ways in start at the
     END of the through road, nine thousand units out, because that is
     where the road leaves the world and because a van appearing at the
     junction out of nothing is a van that was never anywhere. That is
     the right answer for a night you are watching from inside the
     shop and the wrong one for a night you are standing in the middle
     of: five of the fourteen seconds were a van driving down a road
     nobody can see.

     So when they are coming FOR you they do not drive the road at all.
     They come into being ON IT, `runIn` back from wherever they leave
     it — eleven hundred units, about two seconds once the braking and
     the standing start are paid for — which is the "closer" half of the
     user's request.

     AND OUT OF SIGHT, which is the other half and the reason this is a
     search rather than a number. Eleven hundred units is four van
     lengths: near enough to see one appear if you happen to be looking
     that way. So the point is walked further back, half a thousand at a
     time, for as long as it is inside your view — see trimEntry and
     canSee. Face the road and they come from further off; face the shop
     and they are on you in two seconds from somewhere behind your
     shoulder. Neither case ever shows you a vehicle arriving out of
     nothing, which is the only thing that actually had to be true.

     Inside the building nothing changes: they come the whole length of
     the road from the end of the world, because you are not watching
     it. */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   AND THE ARMY, IN THE SAME NUMBERS

   Read against the SWAT above, which is the only way to read them.
   FEWER AND HEAVIER is the whole design: two carriers a send against
   three vans, two on the road at pressure 1 against six, four soldiers
   on their feet against six — and each of those soldiers is two and a
   third of a trooper with a burst rifle (see ACTORS.ARMY). The ceiling
   is a third of the SWAT's because forty soldiers is already more than
   the sixteen hundred of you can walk through, and because an APC is
   two and a half times a van on the screen: the same ground holds
   fewer of them and reads as fuller.

   THE CLOCKS ARE SLOWER AND THE DOORS ARE FASTER. Seventy seconds
   between sends against fifty-five, because a carrier is not a squad
   car; forty tics between one soldier and the next against fifty,
   because a ramp is not a side door; and eight in the back against six.

   AND THEY STAND FURTHER APART: seven hundred along the ring against
   five hundred and sixty, which is what a vehicle a fifth longer and
   half again wider needs to not be parked inside the last one.

   `at` is the one number that is not about the army at all. It is the
   SWAT's pressure at the moment the army is called — two, which is
   one doubling, which is seventy seconds after your first shot (it was
   eight, three and a half minutes, and the user wanted the army
   sooner) — and from that
   tic the army has a curve of its own starting at 1. So the army
   arrives small while the police are already twofold, and then doubles
   on the same clock underneath them. Nobody leaves.

       quietly stops short of.

       while a point further round, with the tarmac of the lot in front
       of it, would have got most of the way. Same behind the building,
       where the nearest point has the shop in the way.
