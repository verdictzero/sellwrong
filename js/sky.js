/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the sky
   =====================================================================

   A sky sector in this engine draws nothing and lets the background
   through, which is exactly what Doom did and is fine as long as the
   only thing outdoors is a courtyard. It stopped being fine when the
   store got a car park six thousand units across, and it stopped being
   a cylinder when the car park got a forest round it: a strip of
   painted cloud is a horizon, and a forest at night wants a whole sky —
   stars overhead, a glow where the town is, nothing at all where there
   is nothing.

   So the background is a SPHERE, wearing an equirect. It wore a
   photograph — a Polyhaven night, baked to the palette offline — and
   it wears a picture the page bakes now (js/skyart.js), for a given
   hour and weather, re-baked as the night goes. An equirectangular
   picture on a sphere needs no projection maths at all — the sphere's
   own u is longitude and its v is latitude, and turning your head does
   the right thing for free. Looking up shows sky rather than the top
   of a strip, which is the only thing the cylinder could never do.

   Three rules and it is convincing:

   IT IS AT INFINITY. Every frame it is moved to sit on the camera, so
   walking never gets you nearer to it. That is the whole trick — a sky
   you can approach is a wall with stars on it.

   IT IS NOT LIT, AND IT IS NOT IN THE AIR. Fullbright, no distance
   diminishing, drawn first with depth off so everything in the world
   lands in front of it whatever the far plane is doing. And the air —
   the fog every wall fades into — is not applied to it, which is a
   proof and not a preference: the air's colour IS the sky's horizon
   texel, so mixing the sky toward the air would be mixing it toward
   itself. What it DOES get is the smoke, at full distance, because a
   store throwing a column of smoke greys its own sky, and against a
   black night nobody could tell that it did not.

   IT IS SMALLER THAN THE FAR PLANE. Depth off does not switch off
   clipping, and the far plane now follows the weather in — 2600 units
   in mist — so the sphere is scaled each frame to sit inside it.
