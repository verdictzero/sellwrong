/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — every surface in the store, at 64 pixels
   =====================================================================

   Sixty-four pixels is not a limitation here, it is the brief. At one
   texel to one world unit a 64-pixel texture is a 64-unit wall, the
   player is 32 across and can see about eight texels of detail on a wall
   he is standing next to, and every decision about what to draw is
   really a decision about what to LEAVE OUT.

   What survives that cut, in every texture below:

     one big shape      the thing you read from across the store — the
                        shelf bands, the door panel, the corrugations
     one edge           a highlight on the top-left of it, shadow on the
                        bottom-right, always that way round
     dirt at the bottom  because that is where dirt is

   Anything finer than that is gone by the second repeat. A 64-pixel
   texture with six levels of detail in it reads, from two metres, as
   grey.

   THE STORE IS THE PALETTE'S ARGUMENT. Everything out front is bone,
   grey and that corporate red. Everything behind the swing doors is
   rust, brown and bare concrete — no branding, no paint, no pretence.
   The moment the player crosses from one to the other should be legible
   without a single sign, and it is done entirely by which ramps the
   textures on either side were allowed to draw from.

   A ceiling with fittings in it

   A suspended ceiling is a grid of tiles with a fluorescent fitting every
   so often — and "every so often" is the whole problem, because a
   64-pixel texture that tiles every 64 units would put a fitting in
   every single tile.

   So this one is declared as 256 units square: one texture is a 4x4
   block of ceiling tiles with a single twin fitting in it, and the
   fittings land every 256 units instead of every 64. A texel is four
   units instead of one, which is nothing on a surface three metres over
   your head that is never seen square on.

   THE TEXTURE IS THE WHOLE LIGHT. There used to be a LAMP sprite hung
   34 units under the ceiling doing the lit part, and it is gone: the
   fitting is paint, so the paint has to be ALIGHT — a near-white
   diffuser, four tubes at the top of the ramp, and a glow thrown onto
   the tiles around the flange, which is the part that actually says the
   thing is on.

   The old objection to painting a light into a ceiling was that it stays
   lit after you have broken it. It does not, and no sprite was needed to
   fix that: a flat is shaded by its sector's light level like every
   other surface, and the sector's light level IS these fittings (see
   Game.relight). Kill the lights over an aisle and the ceiling that was
   throwing the light goes down with the aisle it was throwing it on.

   The fitting is centred in the texture on purpose. Flats are aligned to
   the world grid and the vertical axis is flipped on upload, so anything
   NOT centred lands somewhere different from where it looks like it
   should, and the lamps hung in world space would miss their holes.

     ceiling tile of sixty-four units. One fitting per texture, dead
     centre, because js/maps/sellwrong.js lays the lamp objects on the
     same 256 pitch at the same offset — a fitting drawn anywhere else is
     a lamp hanging beside a hole.

     WHAT IS DRAWN HERE IS A LIGHT THAT IS ON, and every fitting in the
     shop is the same one, because a tiling texture cannot be anything
     else. That is the trade for having no sprite, and it is the right
     way round: a shop lit evenly by its ceiling is what a shop looks
     like, and the unevenness that matters — the run of lights over a
     fire going out together — comes from the sectors darkening and the
     ceiling charring, both of which this can draw.

/* --- produce: the bins you look down into --------------------------
   A supermarket does not SHELVE fruit and veg, it BINS it — a run of
   open crates at hip height, one category to a crate, shopped by
   looking down into them from the aisle. So the picture that carries
   the department is the one on TOP, and the top of this department was
   SHELFBAK: perforated gondola steel. That is not an oversight anybody
   made on purpose. A fixture in a sector engine is a raised floor with
   a lower texture round its edge, and all the care went into the edge,
   because the edge is the part you can see in a screenshot taken from
   the far end of an aisle. Stand next to it — eye at 49, bench at 40 —
   and the top is nearly all of it.

   One repeat is 64 by 64, which is two metres square, so a five-pixel
   apple is a fifteen-centimetre apple. Every bin is anchored to its own
   south-west corner, so the packing starts at the crate edge rather
   than wherever the world grid happens to fall — the same fix the
   parking bays needed for the same reason.

   PACKED, not scattered: the rows go down at a pitch tighter than one
   item across, so neighbours overlap and the crate liner barely shows.
   A bin with gaps in it reads as a bin somebody has already been
   through, which is a different picture and is the one the flowers
   get. */

/* --- THE STAFF DOOR, AND WHAT IS ROUND IT ---------------------------
   ONE LEAF OF THE PAIR at the back of the shop floor, and like the
   sliders and the fire exit it is a LEAF and not a wall: js/slidedoor.js
   maps it 0..1 in both directions, so the kick plate is at the bottom of
   the door instead of wherever a sixty-four-unit repeat happens to land.

   WHICH IS THE WHOLE STORY OF THIS TEXTURE. It used to be a wall. The
   staff door was the last rising-ceiling door left in the building, and
   a shut Doom door is a sector whose ceiling has come down onto its
   floor — so the disagreement rule drew its face from the floor up to
   whatever the ROOM's ceiling was: three hundred and forty units on the
   shop side, four hundred and four on the stock side. At sixty-four to
   the repeat that is a black slab five storeys high with ten STAFF ONLY
   signs tiled up it, every one of them cut through the word by a seam.
   Nothing was wrong with the picture. It was on the wrong kind of
   surface, and the fix was to stop it being a surface.

   u = 0 IS THE HINGE, which is why there is one texture here and not
   two. The second leaf hangs off the other jamb turned through half a
   circle, so its u runs the other way in the world: the outer stiles
   land at the jambs, the two meeting stiles come together in the middle,
   and the pair is mirrored for free. SLIDEL and SLIDER had to be drawn
   twice only because a pair of sliders both travel the same way.

   AND THERE IS NO WORD ON IT. The sign is a sign — DOORSIGN, a plate
   over the head on the public side, which is where a real one is screwed
   and the only place it reads the right way round. A leaf is
   double-sided: lettering on one is backwards from the stockroom. */

/* What is over the head, and it belongs to the DOORSET rather than to

   A band is drawn ONCE for both of its faces, so whatever goes here is
   seen from the shop floor AND from the stockroom, and those two walls
   are a panelled olive board and bare brick. Put the shop's own wall up
   there and the stockroom gets an olive patch over its door; put the
   stockroom's up there and the shop gets a patch of brick. Put the DOOR
   up there — a transom panel in the same painted steel as the frame —
   and it is right from both sides, because that is a real thing that
   really goes over a door of this kind.

   It also settles an alignment the band could not win. A band starts its
   u at its own first vertex, so WALLPANL over the head landed a quarter
   of a repeat out of phase with the WALLPANL either side of it, and a
   hundred and twenty-eight units of slightly-wrong wall reads as a
   mistake from ten feet away. A panel that is not trying to be the wall
   has nothing to be out of phase with.

   RIBS ON THE EDGES, which is what makes it tile: the upright lands on
   u=0 and the rail on v=0, so at sixty-four to the repeat they fall on
   the two jambs and the centre line of the opening, and on the head and
   every sixty-four units above it. Nothing in the middle of the panel

/* --- THE SHOPFRONT, IN LAYERS ---------------------------------------

   A shop window is not a wall with glass painted on it, and drawing it
   that way is what every flat elevation in this project had in common
   with every other one. A shopfront is an ASSEMBLY, and from the
   pavement you can count the parts:

     the FRAME               aluminium, standing proud of the wall
     an INSET                the reveal behind it
     PANE A                  the outer sheet, with the sky on it
     a GAP, outlined black    the cavity between the sheets
     PANE B                  the inner sheet
     an INSET                and the shop behind that

   All six are real. The frame is free boxes; the two insets are sectors
   in the sixteen units of wall thickness; the panes are MIDDLE textures
   hung in the holes between them, so you look THROUGH one, across a
   cavity, through the other and into the store. See THE GLAZING in
   js/maps/sellwrong.js for the geometry — what follows is the paint.

   SEMI-TRANSPARENT MEANS STIPPLED, and that is not a compromise, it is
   the only thing this engine will do. Nothing in this game has partial
   alpha: snapImageData in js/palette.js sets every surviving pixel to
   255 and says "no partial alpha, ever" while it does it, and a wall
   material is alpha-TESTED and never blended. So a half-silvered sheet
   of glass is drawn the way a half-silvered sheet of glass was drawn in
   1996 — an ordered dither of pixels that are there and pixels that are
   not.

   WHICH MEANS THE MIPMAPS ARE THE DESIGN. A fifty-per-cent checker
   averages to fifty per cent one mip level down, and an alpha test at
   0.5 turns that into all or nothing: a pane that vanishes at ten
   metres, or one that goes solid. So the veil is DENSER AT THE EDGES OF
   THE PANE THAN IN THE MIDDLE. Walk away and the mip chain averages it;
   the border firms up into solid glass and the middle opens out. Which
   is the right way round — the pane you can see through is the one you
   are standing at, and from the far side of the car park a shopfront is
   a sheet of reflection anyway.

/* --- THE SHUT ONES -------------------------------------------------

   Most of this parade is empty, and what an empty parade IS, from the
   car park, is a run of metal. Not graffiti, not boarding, not TO LET
   signs: a hundred and thirty metres of roller shutter that somebody
   pulled down for the last time a few years ago and has not been back
   to. So these two are the most-seen surfaces on the whole building
   after the tarmac, and they are drawn to be read at two distances —
   as a grey band from the road, and as WORN METAL from the footway.

   ONE REPEAT IS FOUR LATHS AND NOTHING ELSE, which is the whole of the
   tiling decision. A shopfront runs from FLOOR_WALK to CEIL_SOFF, which
   is 220, and these were declared 64 — so they tiled three and a half
   times up the glass and the half was visible: whatever was at the
   bottom of the tile appeared three and a half times up the shutter, at
   three different heights. Declared 55 they tile exactly four times,
   and declared 72 exactly six across a 432-wide unit, so there is no
   partial repeat anywhere and no seam to find.

   WHICH MEANS NOTHING IN HERE MAY HAPPEN ONCE. No bottom rail, no lock,
   no guides — a shutter's curtain is the same thing all the way up and
   that is exactly what makes it tileable. The bottom rail is a free box
   standing on the footway (SHUTRAIL, and DRESSING THE PARADE in
   js/maps/sellwrong.js), which is where a thing that happens once
   belongs. Same argument as the coping and the parapet.

/* --- AND THE DEAD ONES ---------------------------------------------

   A blank tray is not an empty shop. The fourteen unnamed units carried
   a painted board in one of six colours whether the lights were on or
   not, and what that draws, at the user's request to make the empty ones
   read as empty, is a parade where every fascia looks maintained and
   only the glass tells you anything. The sign is the bigger surface and
   it was saying nothing.

   WHAT AN ABANDONED FASCIA LOOKS LIKE is three things, in this order of
   how far off you can read them:

     the colour has gone. Not darker — CHALKED, which is pale and flat
     and slightly the wrong hue, because what is left is the filler in
     the paint after the binder has gone;
     there is a CLEAN BAND across it where the sign panel was bolted,
     which the weather never got at, so the one part of the board that
     still has its colour is the part nobody can see any more;
     and everything below the fixings is stained, because water has been
     coming out of two holes in a board for six years.

   THE CLEAN BAND IS THE WHOLE IDEA and it is also the only version of
   "you can see where the letters were" that is allowed to exist here. A
   fascia tiles nearly seven times along one unit, so a ghost WORD would
   be seven ghost words, which is the mistake the agent's board made and
   the mistake the painted coping made. A horizontal band tiles
   perfectly and says the same thing.

   Three of them, because thirteen dead units out of one texture is
   wallpaper. */

   Fourteen more tenancies went into the parade at the user's request and

   of a 96-tall texture and a 432-wide unit says its name seven times, so
   eighteen NAMES along a three-hundred-and-seventy-metre elevation is a
   hundred and twenty-six legible words shouting over the one sign the
   level is about. Four is a parade with character. Eighteen is noise.

   So what these carry is the TRAY and the paint in it, which is all a
   fascia is before anybody screws letters to it: a coloured board with a
   lit top edge, a shadow under it and a decade of weather on it. Six
   colours, and they are the six a shopfitter has in the van — a green,
   a red, a blue, a cream, a brown and a grey-blue — deliberately muted,
   because a row of saturated boards reads as bunting.

   THEY GO DARKER THAN THE NAMED ONES, and that is the point of the
   number rather than an accident of picking it: an unlit board with
   nothing on it is what the far end of a parade looks like at two in the

   drawn separately — which keeps the two in register, so a shelf that
   goes up turns into a burnt version of ITSELF rather than into a
   different shelf.

   Three things happen to a surface that has been on fire, and all three
   are needed or it just looks dim:

     it goes DARK, but not uniformly — soot collects in the recesses and
       the raised edges stay comparatively bare, so the relief that was
       there before is still legible, only inverted
     it goes GREY in patches, because ash is pale, and those patches are

   PAST CHARRED: THE RUIN

   Charring is what a surface looks like when the fire has been over it.
   This is what a BUILDING looks like when the fire has finished with it,
   and it is a different thing: not a darker wall but a wall that is no
   longer there in places, with what was holding it up showing through
   the holes and still glowing.

   FOUR TEXTURES FOR EVERYTHING, and that is the whole trick. A charred
   surface has to remember what it was — burnt shelving and a burnt
   ceiling tile are different pictures — so there is a `_B` twin for
   every charrable texture and there are forty of them. A GUTTED surface
   does not: past a certain point a partition, a chiller surround and a
   shopfront are all the same rubble, and pretending otherwise would mean
   forty more textures that all had to converge on the same look anyway.
   So four, chosen by which SLOT the surface fills rather than by what it
   used to be — see `guttedSurfaces`.

   They are drawn dark and lit from the cracks, and the game lifts a
   gutted region's ambient, because a burnt-out shed at night with no
   roof is accurately almost black and you still have to walk out
   through it.
   ===================================================================== */

   an accident. Two aisles that burned do not char identically — the
   framing is at a different centre, the deck fell in a different place,
   a different shelf survived — and one texture repeated across a whole
   gutted store reads as a pattern, which is the one thing a ruin must
   not read as. So each of the four is a family of three, and
   `guttedSurfaces` picks a region's by a hash of its index: stable
   across a reload, different from its neighbour's. */

   THE DECK, BURNT THROUGH

   The stage between a deck that is charred and a deck that is not there
   — and the stage that was missing, which is why a gutted store used to
   go from "ceiling" to "sky" with nothing in between.

   This one is MASKED: where the deck has burnt through there is no
   texel at all, and what you see through the hole is whatever is behind
   it, which up here is the framing this roof was sitting on and then the
   night. That is the whole point of drawing it rather than swapping
   straight to sky: a roof with holes in it reads as a ROOF, and a ceiling
   that has been deleted reads as a rendering fault.

   Declared at 128 world units to the tile rather than 64, so a hole is
   about sixty units across and the repeat is coarse enough that a long
   run of it does not read as wallpaper. The ribs and the beam line come
   from the same numbers as RUINDECK, because these are the same roof at
   two different stages of going.

     AND THE ROOF, WHICH FAILS IN THREE STAGES

     It used to fail in one and a half: a small region kept a charred
     deck, and a big one either kept it or became SKY on a coin flip.
     What "became SKY" draws is NOTHING — the engine treats a sky ceiling
     as a hole and does not build a surface — so half a burnt store was a
     clean rectangular absence with a hard edge on it where the next
     aisle's ceiling was still up. That is a hole in the world, not a
     roof that has gone, and it is the thing the user asked to stop
     seeing.

     So, in order of how much fire has been through:

       THE DECK HOLDS. A small span, or a big one that got lucky:
       RUINDECK, which is the charred underside of a roof that is still
       a roof.

       THE DECK IS HOLED. RUINHOLE, which is MASKED — the burnt-through
       parts are not drawn at all, so you see the framing under it and
       the night past that, and the deck is still overhead between the
       holes. Half its light comes from the sky now, which is what `sky`
       is for.

       THE DECK IS GONE. Sky, as before — but the region is also flagged
       `ruinRoof`, and js/ruin.js builds the steel the deck was sitting
       on: joists across the span, beams on the column lines, some of
       them sagging and some of them down, with the odd panel of deck
       still lying across a bay. Which is what is standing in the
       photograph the morning after a shed like this goes.

     The middle stage is the one that was missing and it is the one that
     does most of the work, because it is what a roof looks like WHILE it
     is failing rather than after.

/* ---------- THE CHURCH IS BUILT OF STONE ----------

   it or not. That is a true thing about a certain kind of New England
   meeting house and it was the wrong building — this one has buttresses,
   a water table, a fieldstone foundation and a stone cornice under its
   spire, and a clapboard wall between those is a wall that disagrees
   with everything it is attached to. At the user's request the whole
   exterior is now ONE STONE: this, over the fieldstone it stands on.

   COURSED ASHLAR, which is the stone a town church is faced with: squared
   blocks in regular courses, the vertical joints staggered against the
   course below. Sixteen to a course, so four courses in a repeat and a
   course is four feet, which is about right for the size the blocks read
   at from the churchyard.

   WHAT SURVIVES AT SIXTY-FOUR PIXELS is the coursing and nothing else.
   The bed joints are the picture — a lit arris along the top of every
   block and a shadow in the joint under it — and the per-block variation
   in tone is what stops four courses of one grey reading as a painted

   THE FENCES, AND WHAT MAKES ONE READ AS ITSELF

   A fence in this engine is a masked texture hung in the hole between
   two patches of ground (see `fence` in js/maps/town.js), so the whole
   of a fence IS its texture: there is no geometry to fall back on and
   nothing behind it but the world. Which means the thing that decides
   whether you believe it is not the material, it is the HARDWARE — the
   post, the rail, the way the wire is fastened. A mesh with no post is
   a pattern. A mesh on a post with a rail across the top is a fence.

   BOTH OF THESE ARE ONE REPEAT OF A REAL BAY, at the width the SIZES
   table hangs them: a chain link panel between two posts, and a run of
   picket between two posts. So the post lands where a post goes and
   not wherever the tiling happens to put it.
   ===================================================================== */

       the one part of a chain link fence that is SOLID, it catches the
       sky along its upper edge and it is what stops the whole thing
       reading as a net hung off nothing.
       THE SELVAGE under it — the mesh is not cut off square at the top,
       it is KNUCKLED: every strand turns over and goes back down, so
       the top row is a row of little arches and not a row of spikes.
       THE MESH, and it is WOVEN. Two families of diagonal strands, and
       at every crossing one of them passes in front of the other,
       alternating. Drawn as a crosshatch instead — which is what this
       was — it reads as a screen door, because a crosshatch has no
       depth and the eye knows it.
       THE POST at the end of the bay, and the TENSION BAR wired to it,
       which is the flat strap the end of the mesh is threaded onto.
       THE BOTTOM TENSION WIRE, a single strand run through the last row

   WHAT A STRIP MALL HAS THAT A SHED DOES NOT

   The same argument as the section above, made about a different kind of
   building. A parade is a long shed with a fascia screwed to the front of
   it, and drawn as sectors alone that is exactly what it looks like: four
   horizontal bands stacked up, thirteen thousand units wide, nothing
   standing out of any of them. What is missing is not ornament. It is the
   PLANT — the coping that keeps the rain out of the top of the wall, the
   packaged air conditioners that are the only reason a windowless shed is
   habitable, the gutter, the downpipes, the ladder somebody has to get up
   there on, the meters, the condensers, the skip. A supermarket is a
   machine with a shopfront on it, and every one of these is a piece of
   the machine that is on the OUTSIDE.

   THEY ARE READ FROM TWO PLACES and nowhere else: from the car park,
   which is between a hundred and four thousand units away and looking
   slightly up, and from the footway, which is under the canopy looking
   along it. So the roof plant is drawn to be read as a SILHOUETTE above
   the coping line, and everything at head height is drawn to be read at
