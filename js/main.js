/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — boot
   =====================================================================

   Bake the art, fetch the few things that are files, build the shop
   and the wood round it, wire it up, and hand the frame loop over to
   Game.

   Almost nothing is downloaded. Every texture and sprite of the STORE
   is generated in this process, at start-up, in about half a second.
   What does arrive as files is what was made elsewhere: the staff, the
   trees and their burn maps, the sky, and the gun — and if any of
   those fails to arrive the game runs without it rather than not at
   all, which is why each load is a step of its own with a fallback.

   This file also owns THE PAGE AROUND THE GAME: the title, the pause
   menu, which kind of machine this is and what that changes. The rule
   is that the game never finds out — it reads one Input, and whether
   that Input is a keyboard or two thumbs is settled out here.

   filter runs once per chunky pixel, and the palette search that used to
   run once per screen pixel now runs there too.

   OFF is last because it is the finest setting there is — the grid
   becomes the buffer, which is exactly what this game did before the two

   5:6 off 720, and before that 200, which is 320x200 at the shape Doom
   was drawn at), off a render fine enough that every one of those

   WHAT TO SPEND THE FRAME ON

   Three ladders, coarse on purpose — a slider from 0 to 1 invites you to
   fiddle and tells you nothing, and there are only ever two or three
   answers worth having. Each is a multiplier the game reads off
   `game.quality`; the simulation never sees them, so the shop is the
   same shop at every setting and only the drawing is cheaper.

   Which of them to reach for first, measured under a software
   rasteriser, where fill rate and draw calls hurt in the same
   proportions they do on a weak phone:

     RENDER   the biggest lever by a long way. Halving the buffer's
              height quarters the pixels
     THE WOOD next: twenty-eight thousand trees in chunks, and hiding
              the far ones was worth four times the frame rate on its
              own
     CROWD    seven hundred standees are seven hundred draw calls,
              because a billboard the shader turns cannot be batched
     EFFECTS  the fire's sprite pool, sorted nearest-and-hottest first,

     THE MENU IS TILES NOW, at the user's request: a square with rounded
     corners for every option, three across and two down, four tabbed
     pages of them, and nothing anywhere that scrolls. A tile carries
     its own name, what it is set to, and a mark saying where that sits
     among what it could be — a dot per stop for a list, a bar for a
     number. Tapping it does one of two things:

       A LIST      cycles to the next value and wraps. Three or four
                   stops is short enough to walk round, and a switch is
                   a list of two
       A NUMBER    opens THE WINDOW, which is the one place left in this
                   menu with a slider in it: a dial between two numbers
                   on a tile would be a slider the size of a stamp

     What the page holds and what the code reaches for are two files
     apart, so the smoke test holds them against each other — a typo in
     either leaves a tile that lights up under the thumb and does
     nothing at all. */

     WHAT THE SCREEN CAN HOLD

     js/palette.js keeps two boxes and they answer different questions.
     The ART palette is what every texture and sprite was PAINTED in —
     the fifteen material ramps — and it never changes. The DISPLAY
     palette is what the screen can hold, and it is a setting: the same
     ramps, or the Uzebox's, which is a real console's hardware limit of
     three bits of red, three of green and two of blue.

     THE DITHER IS WHAT MAKES THAT WORK. The post pass already dithers
     the finished frame and snaps it through a lookup cube; point that
     cube at a smaller box and the ordered dither carries the art's full
     colour down to it at the last moment, which is how a console
     palette reads as a console rather than as four flat bands. Painting
     the textures in the small box as well was the first attempt and it
     was worse: dithering at 64 texels and then again at grid
     resolution, and two dithers over each other are not twice the
     texture, they are noise.

     SO THERE ARE TWO THINGS TO REMAKE and they are both pictures of the
     cube rather than pictures of the art: the cube itself, and THE SKY,
     which is baked through it (js/skyart.js snaps in its own texels so
     the grain sits still) and is therefore in the old box until it is
     baked again. Nothing else moves, which is why this is a few
     milliseconds rather than a re-bake of the game.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------ */
  function applyPalette(name) {
    if (!setDisplayPalette(name)) return false;
    pipeline.rebuildLut();
    skyBaker.bake(game.weather.frame);
    return true;

  /* and the choice the player last made, applied before the first frame */
  const wanted = PALETTE_SET[prefs.palette]?.v;
  if (wanted && wanted !== displayName) applyPalette(wanted);

  /* ------------------------------------------------------------------
     AND WHAT THE ART IS PAINTED IN, which is the other one

     At the user's request, and asked for as a test that could be undone
     — so it is a setting with two entries in it and not a repaint of
     the repository. Everything in this game that is DRAWN is drawn
     through ramp(key, t), fifteen curves through the colour solid; swap
     the fifteen for fifteen muted, warmer ones of exactly the same
     shape (EARTH_RAMPS in js/palette.js) and every picture the program
     makes comes out recoloured rather than scrambled — because the
     ramps are the same length, so entry n of the palette is the same
     MATERIAL in both boxes.

     WHAT HAS TO BE MADE AGAIN, and it is more than the display palette
     needs because this one changes the art rather than the box it is
     shown in:

       THE TEXTURES, repainted into the same three.js textures every
         material in the scene is already holding (TextureBank.add).
       THE SPRITES, likewise — and then the PHOTOGRAPHS laid over them
         again, because a repaint puts every stand-in back. See
         dressSprites above.
       THE WEAPONS, which are Pix handed to the HUD each frame.
       THE LOOKUP CUBE and THE SKY, exactly as applyPalette does: the
         default display box IS the art palette, the same array, so
         changing the art changes what the screen holds too.

     WHAT IS NOT MADE AGAIN, on purpose: the particle atlases, the GLB
     models, and the photographs themselves. All three are snapped
     through the cube at the last moment like everything else in the
     frame, so they land in the new box anyway — which is the same
     argument the Uzebox palette already makes one paragraph up. The
     difference between that and a repaint is that a repaint DRAWS in
     the new box instead of being quantised into it, and a repaint is
     what the fifteen ramps make possible and a photograph does not.

     THE EMBERS ARE NOT IN IT EITHER, and that is a decision rather than
     an omission. EMBER_RAMP is what everything still glowing after the
     flame has gone is lit by, and the fire is the subject of this game:
     the earth box mutes the whole world and takes only the neon off the
     fire, which is the point of looking at a burning building through
     it.
