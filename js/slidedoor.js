/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the automatic doors
   =====================================================================

   Doom had exactly one door: a ceiling that goes up. Every "door" in the
   original game is that, dressed differently, because the renderer could
   move a sector's height and could not move anything sideways. A shop
   entrance is the one thing in a supermarket that a rising ceiling
   cannot fake — a supermarket entrance slides, everybody has walked
   through ten thousand of them, and a rising portcullis at the front of
   a SellWrong would be the first thing anyone noticed.

   So these are not sectors. They are two quads on a track, held in front
   of the shopfront the way a real slider's leaves run in front of the
   glazing line, and the only thing they share with a Doom door is the
   part that matters: WHAT THEY DO TO THE MAP. A shut door sets
   `blocking` on the lines across the opening and the collision system
   treats them as wall; an open one clears it and the opening is a hole
   again. Nothing else in the engine has to know these exist.

   Two consequences worth stating, because they are the reason the doors
   feel right rather than merely move right:

   THEY OPEN FOR ANYTHING. The trigger is a proximity test against the
   player AND every solid actor, so the staff walk out through them, and
   a store you have set alight vents itself through a front door that
   keeps being opened by whatever is coming at you.

   THEY BURN. Once the entrance is charred the leaves are stuck: the
   glass is gone, the motor with it, and the doors stop being a door and
   start being a hole with two burnt frames in it. Which is a nicer way
   of saying that after a certain point in a match you can no longer shut
   the front of the shop behind you.

   AND THE FIRE EXITS SWING, which is why this file is not called
   slidedoor.js any more than it has to be. A quad on a transform can be
   MOVED along the wall or TURNED about one end of it, and the second one
   is a hinge — so the same class, the same state machine and the same
   blocking lines give both the entrance and the six crash-bar doors down
   the sides of the building. The two differences are in the spec:

     swing    one leaf instead of two, turned up to a right angle about
              the (x0,y0) end rather than slid. It turns OUTWARD, away
              from the shop, because that is which way a fire door opens
              and it is not a detail — a door that opens inward against a
              crowd is the thing every fire regulation in the world
              exists to prevent.
     panicOnly  the mat under it only trips for somebody who is running.
              A fire exit is not an automatic door: it is shut all night
              and it opens when a person in a hurry leans on the bar. The
              player counts as such a person at any time, because the
              player is allowed to walk out of a building.
