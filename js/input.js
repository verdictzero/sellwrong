/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — input
   =====================================================================

   One layer over keyboard, mouse, gamepad and touch, because the game
   should not care and there is no version of caring that ends well.
   Everything downstream reads the same four numbers and the same set of
   named buttons.

     move.x   -1 .. 1   strafe
     move.y   -1 .. 1   forward
     look.x             yaw this frame, in radians
     look.y             pitch this frame, in radians

   Buttons are edge-detected here rather than downstream: `pressed()` is
   true for exactly one frame, `down()` for as long as it is held. Weapon
   switching wants the first, the flamethrower wants the second, and
   working that out at each call site is how you end up with a
   flamethrower that fires once.

   MOUSE LOOK is pointer-locked and accumulates between frames rather
   than being sampled, so a fast flick is not lost between two vsyncs.

   TOUCH is written into `touch` by touch.js and read here like any other
   device. The two never fight because the game is in one MODE at a time,
   and the mode is whichever device spoke last: a phone with a keyboard
   plugged in is a desktop until it is tapped, and a laptop with a screen
   you can poke is a phone until a key goes down. Pointer lock belongs to
   the desktop mode only — on a phone it fails, and on a phone with a
   mouse it would be a mistake.
