/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — a hole through a wall
   =====================================================================

   AT THE USER'S REQUEST: "any structure in the path of the beam has a
   hole blown through it, the hole will then decay into debris and
   burning". This file is the hole.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHY IT IS NOT A DECAL

   The game already has a decal system, and a very big scorch on a wall
   would have been half an hour's work. It would also have been a
   PICTURE of a hole: you could not see through it, shoot through it or
   walk through it, and the first thing a player does after firing a
   two-hundred-unit column of plasma through the front of a house is
   walk into the house through the front of it. A hole that is only a
   picture is a lie that is found out immediately.

   So it is geometry. A wall in this game is a LINE (js/level.js), drawn
   as a quad spanning the line's length and some interval of height. A
   hole is the statement that a RECTANGLE of that quad is no longer
   there — and everything else in this file is the arithmetic of saying
   that, once, in a form that the renderer, the collision, the bullets
   and the sight line can all read.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE COORDINATES, AND WHY THEY ARE THESE

   A breach is { t0, t1, z0, z1 }:

     t   how far along the line, as a FRACTION of its length, because
         that is what js/mapgeo.js's addQuad already takes as `span` —
         it was built for the two pieces of wall either side of a
         gable's ridge, and a hole is the same question asked twice
     z   world height, in the game's own units, because that is what
         every other height in the engine is and a hole has to be
         comparable with a floor, a ceiling and a player's eye

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   PUNCHING MERGES RATHER THAN APPENDS

   The beam is out for three to five seconds and punches on its
   structural clock, which is a dozen times a second: a wall the column
   is sitting on would collect sixty rectangles, all of them nearly the
   same rectangle. So a punch that OVERLAPS what is already gone grows
   that hole to the union instead of adding to the list, which is both
   cheaper and truer — a wall does not get two holes where one beam
   crossed it, it gets a bigger hole.

   And the list is capped. Past MAX_PER_LINE a new punch grows the
   NEAREST existing hole rather than being dropped: a wall that has been
   shot at all day ends up with a few large holes rather than a hundred
   small ones, which is what a wall that has been shot at all day looks
   like, and it keeps the split below bounded.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   AND THE SPLIT IS A GRID, WHICH IS THE WHOLE TRICK

   "Draw this rectangle except for those rectangles" is, in general, an
   awkward problem. It stops being awkward the moment you stop trying to
   be clever about it: take every hole edge that falls inside the wall,
   cut the wall along all of them in both axes, and you have a grid of
   cells each of which is ENTIRELY inside a hole or entirely outside
   one. Test each cell's middle, keep the ones that survive, and then
   merge each row of survivors back into runs so a wall with one hole in
   it comes out as four quads rather than eight.

   With MAX_PER_LINE at four that is at most a ten-by-ten grid, tested
   once per wall per rebuild, and a rebuild happens when a block's
   geometry changes and not otherwise.
   ===================================================================== */

/* How many holes one wall may carry before new ones start growing old
   ones instead. Four, because the split is quadratic in this and
   because five holes in one wall is a wall that should have fallen
   down. */

/* THE SMALLEST PIECE OF WALL WORTH DRAWING, in WORLD UNITS in both
   axes — and it is a hair, not a plank.

   The first cut of this wrote the horizontal one as a fraction of the
   line, 0.004, which is one and a half units on a garden wall and
   SIXTEEN on a shopfront. On the shopfront the scorched strips down the
   sides of a hole are three and a half thousandths of the line wide;
   they fell under the limit, were dropped, and what was left was a slot
   from the floor to the ceiling either side of the opening that you
   could see daylight through. The area arithmetic caught it — the
   pieces and the holes no longer came to the wall — which is why that
   sum is checked and not merely computed.

   So both are in units, both are a twentieth of one, and dropping a
   piece is not how coincident cut lines are dealt with any more: they
   are DEDUPLICATED before the grid is walked, so no cell is ever
   degenerate and no kept cell is ever thrown away. A dropped piece is a
   hole nobody asked for. */

   AND THE SYSTEM THAT PUNCHES THEM AND THEN LETS THEM GO
   =====================================================================

   The arithmetic above is pure and knows nothing about the game. This
   part knows about the game and nothing about the arithmetic: which
   walls a column crosses, what falls out of them, and what a hole looks
   like a few seconds after it was made.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   FINDING THE WALLS

   The obvious way is Level.rayHitWall, and it is wrong twice over: it
   returns the FIRST wall and stops, and the whole point of this weapon
   is that it does not stop. So the segment is marched through the
   blockmap instead — a small box at each step, deduplicated — and every
   line that actually crosses the column is punched. Sixty-four queries
   for the longest shot in the game, and the blockmap was built for
   exactly this kind of question.

   HOW WIDE THE HOLE IS is not the column's diameter. A cylinder of
   radius R crossing a plane at an angle cuts a chord of 2R/sin(angle),
   and a beam that grazes a wall at ten degrees cuts a hole six times
   its own width — which is right, and is also why it is capped: at one
   degree the chord is the whole street, and a shot fired ALONG a
   terrace should not delete the terrace.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   AND THEN IT DECAYS

   At the user's request, and it is the half that makes it a hole in a
   building rather than a hole in a picture. A fresh breach is a clean
   cut through brick. Over DECAY_TICS it does three things:

     it crumbles    the opening grows in DECAY_STEPS discrete jumps —
                    discrete because every change to a hole rebuilds the
                    block it is in, and a smooth grow is a rebuild every
                    frame
     it sheds       debris falls out of the widening edge and the dust
                    of it hangs at the foot
     it burns       the fire grid is lit at the hole, so the opening
                    goes on burning by itself and the region around it
                    chars on the fire's own clock

   The clock stops after that. A hole that grew for ever would eat the
   building, and the building coming down is the structural damage's job
   (see FireSystem.damageLine), which is a different question with its
   own answer.
