/* =====================================================================
   PACKING THE SITE UP, from inside the site

   At the user's request: a DOWNLOAD in the pause menu that hands you
   the whole game as one file, to keep and to run without a network.

   There is no server here to ask for a zip — the game is a static page
   and the only machine involved is the one already holding every file,
   because it fetched them to play. So the page builds the archive
   ITSELF: it reads the packing list, fetches each file back (out of the
   browser cache, mostly, which is why a sixty-megabyte download takes a
   few seconds rather than a few minutes), and writes a ZIP by hand.

   THE ZIP IS STORED, NOT DEFLATED. Fifty-six of the sixty megabytes are
   PNGs, MP3s and GLBs, all of them compressed already; squeezing the
   two and a half megabytes of source on top would cost a pass over
   everything to save under two per cent. So every entry goes in flat,
   which makes the writer small enough to read in one sitting: a header
   per file, a table of them at the end, and a CRC of each.
   ===================================================================== */

/* WHERE THE LIST COMES FROM. tools/build-site.sh writes files.json into
   the deployed site — the authority on what the site is, because it is
   generated from what was actually copied — and the same list is kept
   in the repository so a checkout served straight off the disk packs
   too. The smoke test regenerates it and fails if the two drift. */

   WHAT IS IN THE BOX, besides the game

   Every file is an ES module, and a browser will not load one over
   file:// — it is a cross-origin request from a page with no origin,
   and it fails with a message about CORS that says nothing about what
   to do. So the archive carries the answer in a text file next to the
   page: one line to serve the folder, and the address to open.

`GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — running it on your own machine
=========================================================

Everything the game needs is in this folder. It does not phone home,
it does not need a network once it is unpacked, and there is nothing
to install or compile.

BUT IT CANNOT BE OPENED BY DOUBLE-CLICKING index.html. The game is
written as ES modules, and a browser refuses to load a module from a
file:// address — it treats the page as having no origin and blocks
its own files. You need any web server, pointed at this folder. One of
these, run from inside it, is enough:

    python3 -m http.server 8000
    npx http-server -p 8000 .
    php -S localhost:8000

Then open:

    http://localhost:8000/

Stop the server with ctrl-C when you are done.

WHAT IS HERE
    index.html          the page
