/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — a crowd in as many draw calls as it has
   pictures
   =====================================================================

   Every thing in this game that is a SPRITE — the shoppers, the
   trolleys, the crates, the bollards, the headstones — used to be its
   own mesh with its own material. That is the obvious way to do it and
   it is what js/actor.js did for a long time, because the quad is spun
   and scaled by uniforms and uniforms belong to a material.

   IT COSTS ONE DRAW CALL AND ONE UNIFORM BLOCK PER PERSON. Measured, in
   the car park at eight in the morning: seven hundred and seventy-two
   things drawn, and nine hundred and seventy-four draw calls in the
   frame. The crowd was four fifths of the frame's draw calls and most
   of what the renderer did with its time.

   AND THEY SHARE TWENTY-EIGHT PICTURES BETWEEN THEM. That is the whole
   of why this file exists. A shopper is ONE drawing that faces every
   way — js/spriteload.js says so at the top, and it is true of
   everything that came off a strip — so seven hundred and seventy-two
   people are seventeen shoppers repeated, plus the trolleys and the
   crates. Batch by PICTURE and the crowd is twenty-eight calls.

   HOW. One InstancedBufferGeometry per texture: a unit quad, and a
   buffer of where each instance is, how big, how lit, and the four
   flags the fragment shader reads per sprite. The shader is the SAME
   shader — see the INSTANCED_SPRITE block in js/material.js, where the
   four values that were uniforms are declared as varyings under the
   same names, so that not one line of the body of either stage knows
   which way it is being drawn. A crowd drawn this way cannot look
   different from a crowd drawn the other way.

   THE BATCHES ARE KEPT, not rebuilt: a texture that has been drawn once
   keeps its buffers for the rest of the session and its instance count
   goes to zero on the frames nobody is in front of it. Nothing is
   allocated per frame; the buffers double when a crowd outgrows them
   and never shrink, which for a fixed cast is a handful of doublings at
   the start and none afterwards.

   WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not an atlas. An atlas would make the whole
   crowd ONE call rather than twenty-eight, and it would mean packing
   every sprite in the game into one texture and carrying a UV rect per
   instance. Twenty-eight is close enough to one that the packing is not
   worth what it would cost to get wrong, and the gap between 974 and
   about 230 is the part that mattered.

   SORTING DOES NOT ARISE. Every sprite here is a CUT-OUT: alpha-tested,
   depth-written, no blending. Two of them in any order come out the
   same, which is the reason Doom could draw its sprites in whatever
   order it liked too.
