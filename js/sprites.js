/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the sprite bank
   =====================================================================

   Doom's sprite naming, because it is a good scheme and because every
   piece of documentation about how Doom animates its monsters is written
   in it:

     BLSTA1   four letters of sprite name, one frame letter, one rotation
              digit. Rotation 1 is head-on, 2 through 8 go round, and 0
              means "this frame looks the same from everywhere".

   Frame letters run A, B, C... in the order the animation uses them, and
   the state tables in states.js refer to them exactly that way. So

     WALK: A A B B C C D D
     DIE:  H I J K L

   is both the documentation and the code.

   NOBODY IN THIS FILE IS A PERSON ANY MORE. There were two monsters
   built here out of a jointed figure — a rig, a walk cycle, eight
   rotations rendered per frame, faces projected onto a sphere so they
   turned with the head — and they are gone, along with js/figure.js and
   the Freedoom frames that ended up replacing them. The people in the
   shop now are painted standees from the galvarius project, and they
   arrive as a strip; js/people.js cuts it up and hands it to this bank.

   What is left here is everything the game draws ITSELF: the fire, the
   trolleys, the crates, the light fittings, the blood, the weapons in
   your hands and the placeholders that stand in for any of the outside
   art that has not arrived. The placeholders matter more than they look
   — the game has to run with an empty assets/ directory, because that
   is what the headless test does.

  /* --- and what stands over it -------------------------------------
     A FIRE WITHOUT SMOKE IS A LIGHT. Everything about a burning
     supermarket that you would actually notice from the car park is the
     smoke: it is bigger than the flames by a factor of ten, it is the
     thing that gets into the aisle you were about to walk down, and it
     is the only part of a fire that is still there after the fire is
     out. There was already drifting smoke in the game — the puffs off
     js/effects.js, which are particles and go where the wind takes them
     — and no BODY of it standing on the fire itself. This is that body,
     and js/fire.js parks it over the hottest, most buried cells.

     IT CHURNS AND IT LOOPS EXACTLY, by the trick fbm makes free: the
     noise lattice wraps after h rows, so sampling it with a vertical
     offset of h/count per frame comes back to itself after count
     frames. The same field decides the silhouette AND the shading, so
     the scroll that stirs the inside also eats the outline — which is
     what separates smoke from a grey ball with a pattern on it.

     SIXTEEN AND NOT EIGHT, at the user's request that it be smoother.
     The loop was always exact; what it was not was FINE. Eight frames
     over a loop that wants to last a second and a half is a step every
     eleven tics, and eleven tics of a 64-pixel sprite holding still is
     long enough to see it holding still — the churn read as a flick
     book. Sixteen is the same loop with half the step, and it costs
     eight more 64-square sprites, which is nothing. The step it wraps by
     stays exact because H divides by 16 as happily as by 8.

     NOT SNAPPED, unlike almost everything else here. A cut-out edge is
     what makes a Doom sprite a Doom sprite and it is exactly wrong for
     this: smoke has no edge, and the alpha ramp is the whole effect. */

     the splat with the red taken out. A splat is a stain: flat, thin,

     where they stood leaves a HEAP — narrower than the splat is wide,
     banked up in the middle, with the shape of a person's footprint
     still in it if you are generous.

     THREE LAYERS AND THE ORDER MATTERS. A wide scatter of pale grey
     first, which is the ash that went sideways and settled; then the
     heap itself in the dark end of the grey ramp, because ash in a pile
     is nearly black and only reads as ash by the dust around it; and
     then a handful of coals — rust and yellow, four or five of them, no
     more — sitting in the top of it. The coals are what stop it reading
     as a puddle of dirty water. There is no ember shader on a sprite
     (that is a SURFACE thing, see js/material.js), so the last warmth
     of a person has to be painted in.

     Squashed like the splat is, and for the same reason: it is lying on

     is a quarter of the width or it reads as a ball. Three of them,
