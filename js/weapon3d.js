   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the thing in your hands
   =====================================================================

   FOUR MODELS NOW, and this file used to be certain there was one.
   Three are somebody else's, dropped in as they stand: the
   flamethrower the user built was replaced by one of Vaportrash's, at
   the user's request, and the extinguisher and the cerebral bore came
   from there too. The fourth, the minigun, is the user's own again, and
   carries its own nozzle and a barrel set that turns — see GUNS.
   All are .glb, all are drawn in the same little scene
   in front of the world, and that scene has its own perspective camera
   sitting at the origin looking down -z with the gun parked in front of
   it in metres — so "where the gun is on screen" is the handful of
   numbers in VIEW below, and nothing about the level or the player's
   position enters into it.

   BOTH ARE LOADED AT START AND ONE IS VISIBLE. Swapping weapons hides a
   group and shows another, which costs nothing; loading on the switch
   would cost a hitch in the middle of the one moment the player is
   asking for something to happen.

   IT IS DRAWN INTO THE SAME LOW-RES BUFFER as the world, after it and
   over it, with depth cleared in between so the barrel never pokes
   through a wall you are standing against. That buffer is what keeps a
   1024-pixel painted diffuse honest: at three hundred rows the texels
   are chunky again, and the palette snap eats the gun along with the
   floor.

   HEAVILY LOW AND RIGHT, as asked — the body of the gun is off the
   bottom of the frame and the barrel comes in across the lower right
   quarter, the way it is drawn in every game that got this right. What
   is on screen is the end that matters: the nozzle, whatever is burning
   under it, and what comes out.

   WHERE THE NOZZLE IS, AND HOW IT WAS FOUND. It used to be two ways:
   the old flamethrower carried marker spheres, put there in Blender by
   the user and baked into the file's extras by tools/prep-model.mjs,
   and everything else said so in GUNS below. There is only the second
   way now, because there is no longer a model in the game that the
   user made: the standing rule since the van is that somebody else's
   file is not rewritten on the way in, so the anchors are numbers in
   GUNS, in the MODEL'S own units — the game saying where it intends to
   point rather than the game editing the asset. The reader they are
   read back through (asset.extras.anchors) is kept, because a model
   that does carry markers is still handled.

   AND THE NUMBERS WERE MEASURED OFF PICTURES. A gun with no markers has
   to be looked at: the new flamethrower was drawn flat from its left,
   from above and straight down the barrel, over a grid ruled in the
   model's own units, with candidate points crossed on it and moved
   until they sat where they belong. That is how [0, 3.9, 24.3] and
   [0, 3.0, 25.7] below came to be — the centre of the bore inside the
   C-shaped muzzle bracket, and the lip of the little gold igniter pipe
   that runs under the barrel and turns up in front of it. Reading the
   bounding box of a part would have put the first of them inside the
   metal and the second on the wrong tube.

   AND ONE OF THEM HAD TO BE RESIZED, which is the other thing a file
   somebody else made will do to you. The flamethrower is 1.4 units nose
   to tail and centred on its own origin; the extinguisher is 4.7 units
   long and stands on that origin like a model on a table. `fit` scales a
   model to the game's length and recentres it on its own bounding box,
   and the anchor goes through the same transform, so a gun either
   arrives in this scene's frame already or says what to do about it.

             VIEW.pos's z, which is how much of the gun's LENGTH is on
             screen: at 1 the back quarter of a gun is behind the eye and
             what you see is the front half, filling the corner; at 3 the
             whole thing is in front of you and reads end to end. Absent
             means 1
     nozzle  where the business end is, in the MODEL'S own units. Absent
             means the file says so itself, in asset.extras.anchors
     pilot   a small flame that is always alight, on the same terms.
             A gun that does not burn anything does not have one
     tint    what the muzzle effect is coloured, and `cold` whether the
             frames are desaturated first. The two weapons use the same
             twenty frames of billowing and differ by those two: one is
             fire as painted, one is the white-blue of something very
             cold leaving a nozzle very fast
     muzzle  how long and wide that effect is, in metres
     pos     a gun's own offset on VIEW.pos, in metres, for one that is
             carried somewhere other than where a hose is. Absent means
             none
     rot     and its own turn on VIEW's, pitch yaw roll, for the same
             reason. Absent means none
     heat    the material that glows with use, the run of the barrels
             along it, and WHICH NUMBER ON THE PLAYER it reads — see
             GUN_FRAG. Two guns have one and they must not share a
             number, or a minigun put away hot hands its glow to
             whatever is drawn next
     spin    turns a second the part the file names as rotating makes
             at full speed. Only the minigun has one
     display a material the file paints flat, which is a SCREEN: it gets
             the live feed and the gauges instead of the gun shader —
             see js/scope.js. Only the lance has one
     optics  and a material that is a LENS, for the same reason
     aim     a SECOND hold, for a gun that is raised to the eye rather
             than carried at the hip: its own pos, rot and out, blended
             to by Weapon3D.aim. The lance has one, and so does the
             launcher, because both have something on them worth
             putting your eye to
     paint   'vertex' for a model whose colour is in its VERTICES rather
             than in a texture — a sculpt, painted where it was modelled,
             shipped straight out of tools/decimate-model.mjs. A texture
             in the file wins over it. No gun in the rack uses it now:
             the launcher did until it was baked
     screen  a screen the game BUILDS, for a gun whose file has a flat
             face where a screen should be and no mesh to put one on:
             [x0, y0, x1, y1, z] in the model's own units, a quad facing
             the eye at that depth. It wears whatever screen the gun's
             scope makes, exactly as `display` does
     tubes   more than one mouth, for a gun that has more than one: each
             in the model's own units, like `nozzle`. What leaves them is

     Vaportrash's again, and this one carries its own answers the way
     the minigun did — not as marker spheres but as NAMED MESHES. Four
     meshes on three materials: `wzbr_mat`, the painted metal, over
     seventy thousand vertices of receiver and barrel; `optics_mat`, a
     fifty-millimetre lens up front, painted flat green; and
     `dynamic_display_surface_mat`, a panel eighty millimetres across on
     the rear deck facing straight back at whoever is holding it, painted
     flat near-black. A modeller does not name a node
     `dynamic_display_surface_1` by accident. See js/scope.js for what
     goes on it.

     THE LONGEST THING IN THE RACK by half again — two and a half metres
     of gun, and `fit` keeps it that — and HELD THE FURTHEST OUT, which
     is not vanity. The panel sits at the BACK of the model; the back of
     a two-and-a-half-metre weapon held where a hose is held is inside
     the near plane and across the whole picture. Pushed out it recedes
     to where a monitor on a gun should be: readable, in the upper left
     of the corner the gun fills, with the barrel running away from it
     to the muzzle. `pos` then slides the whole thing left and down so
     the screen clears the middle of the frame rather than sitting in
     it, and `rot` cants it a few degrees so you are looking at the
     panel rather than across it.

     IT HAS NO `heat`, and it used to. The whole chassis glowed with the
     coil, from the middle out, on GUN_FRAG's second gradient mode — the
     mode exists for this gun and this gun is the only thing that ever
     asked for it. At the user's request the lance does not heat at all
     any more, so the entry is gone and the mode is left where it is:
     one branch behind `if (heat > 0.001)`, which nothing on this weapon
     now satisfies, and which the next gun that heats from its middle
     will find already written and already correct.

     The muzzle effect is small and additive and green-white — the thing
     that says this gun is firing is the beam, which is js/beam.js's, and
     this is only the bloom where it leaves the metal. */

       inboard until the panel on its rear deck is in the middle of the
       frame and a hand's breadth from the eye, and the turn cancels
       VIEW's own cant so you are looking at the screen square on rather
       than across it. `out` pulls it in: the whole gun is nearer,
       because you have brought it to you.

       THESE FOUR NUMBERS WERE SOLVED, not nudged. With the panel's own
       corners projected through the weapon camera, both its position

       `out` — measured d = 0.330*out - 0.481 over four settings, and
       the panel's height in clip units is 0.1333/d to four places. So

     of a 512 sheet back to the sculpt for its colour: a fifth of the

     right shoulder, the tubes running forward past the hand and the
     back half of the box over the shoulder and out of the picture. The
     numbers were measured off the vertices, not guessed:

       the front face is flat at z = 0.999 and the four mouths are
       recesses four centimetres into it, square, centred on x = 0.039
       and 0.498 and on y = 0.218 and -0.225. `tubes` is those four,
       at the face, in the order they fire — top left, top right,
       bottom left, bottom right, as the gunner sees them, since the
       half turn puts the model's +x on the left: a salvo ripples
       across the box rather than down one side of it.

       the sight is a box of its own bolted to the model's +x side,
       which the half turn every gun gets puts on the LEFT of the
       picture, next to the eye. Its back is flat at z = 0.089, in the
       sculpt and in the cage both, and runs 0.78 to 1.02 across and
       0.07 to 0.24 up. It is a face where a screen should be with
       nothing on it, so `screen` makes one: the same face less its
