/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the quad launcher's seeker and its missiles
   =====================================================================

   FOUR TUBES AND A HEAT SEEKER, at the user's request: "a heat seeking
   quad shot function, can fire up to four at once with four locks".
   That sentence is the whole design, and everything below is one of
   its words.

   THE SEEKER. Hold the trigger and the launcher looks for heat down the
   middle of the view — a cone of six degrees round where the eye is
   pointing, out to the far side of the town. Whatever warm thing is
   nearest the middle of it, and in plain sight, is ACQUIRED: a short
   dwell with the seeker growling on it, and then a LOCK, with a tone.
   Keep holding and it goes on: the next warm thing in the cone is
   acquired and locked, and the next, up to four — one per loaded tube,
   because a lock with nothing to fire at it is a promise. If there are
   fewer warm things in the cone than there are tubes, the seeker locks
   the same one again, so four locks on one gunship is four missiles
   into one gunship.

   A lock HOLDS while its target stays roughly where you are looking —
   a much wider cone than the one that took it — and in sight; out of
   either for more than half a second and it is lost. A target that
   dies or goes cold (freezes: the extinguisher makes people cold, and
   a block of ice is not a heat source) is dropped at once.

   THE SALVO. Let go of the trigger and one missile leaves for every
   lock, a tube at a time, a few tics apart — a ripple across the front
   of the box rather than one bang, which is how the thing it is
   modelled on fires. With no locks at all, letting go fires ONE,
   straight down the sight: a launcher that did nothing without a lock
   would be the bore, and the bore already exists.

   THE FLIGHT. Each missile leaves its own tube along the sight, kicked
   a little outward by where that tube sits in the box, so four of them
   fan out for a moment before they turn. Then it steers — no more than
   `turn` radians a tic — at where its target WILL BE, leading it by the
   target's own velocity over the time left to fly. It speeds up the
   whole way. It stops for walls, floors, ceilings, its target and
   anybody standing between it and its target, and after seven seconds
   it stops anyway.

   THE WARHEAD. What it flew into takes the whole of it; everything
   within reach takes a share that falls off with distance. It is a
   BLAST, not fire — the `impact` flag, the same one the bore and a van
   carry — for a reason that is a bug report about Game.explode: that
   one deals `fire`, and the SWAT and the army are fireproof, so a
   blast built on it would kill shoppers and cars and walk straight
   through a trooper. Fire is still what it starts: the floor under it
   catches, and so does anything flammable in reach.

   WHAT IS HOT, which is the one question both halves of this weapon
   ask — the seeker asks it to pick a target and the thermal screen
   (js/thermal.js) asks it to decide what glows — so it is answered in
   exactly one place, heatSources() below: people who are alive and not
   frozen, vehicles with their engine running or on fire, and anything
   flying. A parked car is cold. A dead one is cold.
