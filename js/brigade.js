/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the fire brigade
   =====================================================================

   A supermarket alight is the fire brigade's business, as the top of
   js/responders.js has said since there was a responders.js. TIERS has
   carried "the fire brigade" for as long, as a line in a table that sent
   nobody. This sends somebody, at the user's request: the user's fire
   truck (FireTruck in js/vehicles.js), with its water cannon working.
   It does not yet put firefighters on the ground; the truck is the whole
   of the brigade for now.

   WHAT CALLS THEM IS THE FIRE, not you: anything alight — the store, the
   wood, a car in the lot — for CALL_AFTER seconds, all told. The SWAT
   answer the trigger; the brigade answer the smoke. So a night with a
   gun in it and no fire has no fire engines, and a night of nothing but
   matches has nothing else.

   HOW MANY. One truck at the call, and then another every SEND_EVERY
   seconds for as long as something is still burning, up to one per
   CELLS_PER_TRUCK cells alight and never more than MAX_TRUCKS on the
   scene. A fire that is being won stops the sends; one that is being
   lost brings the whole station.

   WHERE THEY GO is where the fire is. The brigade picks the thickest
   part of whatever is burning (hotspot) and stands a truck as close to
   it as the tarmac allows, on the same ring and by the same arithmetic
   the SWAT use to come to you (Responders.chaseStand), keeping STOP back
   from it because a fire engine parked in the fire is a second fire. A
   fire INSIDE the building is fought from the fire lane, which is what a
   fire lane is: a truck takes a bay in front of the doors, and plays on
   whatever of it the doors let it see.

   THEY COME FROM THE FIRE STATION's end of the road — the town keeps its
   engines in the yard on A5 (see arrivalPoints in js/responders.js) —
   which here means whichever end of the road is the shorter drive to the
   stand, and they come on at the same run-in the SWAT do, out of your
   view, so a truck does not appear in front of you.
