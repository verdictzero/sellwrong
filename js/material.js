/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — materials, and light that steps instead of fading
   =====================================================================

   There is one material in this game and it is unlit. Nothing here has a
   normal, nothing has a specular, nothing is lit by a light source. A
   surface's brightness is a number the map author wrote down, darkened by
   how far away it is, and quantised into 32 steps on the way.

   That last part is the whole trick. Doom did not multiply anything by
   anything — it kept 32 pre-darkened copies of the palette and picked
   one. So light does not fade down a corridor, it STEPS down, and you can
   see the steps, and after thirty years those steps are what the eye
   reads as "this is that kind of game". Smooth falloff costs nothing and
   throws it all away.

   FAKE CONTRAST comes free with the same idea. Doom nudged the light
   level up on walls running east-west and down on walls running
   north-south. It is not a lighting model — there is no sun and the
   nudge is the same at midnight — but it means a corner between two walls
   is always visible, in a renderer with no shading at all. Baked into the
   vertex light by the geometry builder, so it costs nothing here either.

   SMOKE is the one thing that moves. As the store burns, smokeDensity
   climbs and the far end of every aisle goes grey, which is both the
   atmosphere and an honest gameplay signal: when you can no longer see
   the checkouts from Aisle 6, it is time to leave.

   THE AIR is the other thing, and it is always there: every surface
   fades with distance toward the sky behind it — literally a texel of
   the sky bake, in the fragment's azimuth — so the far edge of the
   world is the sky and not a cut. How far the air lets you see is the
   weather's, and it is also the draw distance. See SIGHT.txt.

   THE SHADING IS EXPORTED AS GLSL, not only as materials. The forest,
   the particles and the flame all draw with their own vertex paths —
   instanced, animated, burning — but every one of them has to sit in
   the same light as the walls or it reads as a sticker on the picture.
   So the lighting is two GLSL strings any shader can splice in, and the
   three materials below are only the plain ways of using them.

     AND A SECOND LIGHT, WHICH IS A LINE

     The paragraph below this one says a spotlight was taken out and
     that one light is enough. It is enough for FIRE, and the reasoning
     holds: a burning aisle is one glow because you never see two fires
     as two sources. It does not hold for the positron lance, which is
     not a source at a point — it is a column eight metres across drawn
     from the muzzle to the far side of the map, and the whole thing is
     lit. A point light at the muzzle would put a bright spot on the
     wall you are standing next to and leave the street the beam is
     actually crossing in the dark, which is exactly backwards.

     So this one is a SEGMENT: a start, a direction, a length, and a
     radius round the axis. Every fragment measures its distance to the
     nearest point ON THE LINE, which is one dot product and one
     subtract, and is lit by that. A person standing beside the column a
     hundred metres away is lit as hard as the wall behind the muzzle,
     because they are as near the light.

     AND IT IS DIFFERENTIAL AND RANDOMISED, at the user's request, which
     is the part that makes it read as a discharge rather than as a
     lamp. `beamSeed` is a clock; the noise is keyed off the fragment's
     own world position rounded to a coarse grid, so two objects either
     side of the column flicker at different rates and different phases
     and neither of them flickers with the frame. What you get is a
     street where every surface is being lit by the same thing and none
     of them agrees about it, which is what a fifty-megajoule line of
     plasma a few metres away would actually look like.

     It OUTLIVES THE BEAM. js/beam.js leaves the axis where it was and
     fades the intensity over a second and a half, so the street stays
     lit by a thing that has already gone — the after-image of the shot
     — which is the "post charge" half of the same request.

     paragraph because the reasoning is the file's: the gunship's
     searchlight (js/vtol.js) was a lit cone — spotPos, spotDir, two
     cone cosines, a range and a colour — added on top of the banded
     light the way the fire glow is, on every surface that shades with
     worldShade. It worked. It is gone at the user's request, and what
     is kept instead is the LENS FLARE at the lamp, which is the part
     you actually read a searchlight by at night.

     What it cost while it was here was a branch and a normalize in
     every fragment of every wall, floor, car, tree, sprite and puff in
     the game, for a pool of light on the tarmac that a beam with no
     shadow map put through the roof of the shop as readily as onto the
     lot. One light in this file is the right number, and it is the
     fire.

  /* HOW BURNT EVERY PIECE OF FLOOR IS, as a picture.

     The store's surfaces used to know three things about the fire:
     untouched, charred, gutted. Two steps, both of them a texture swap,
     and between them nothing — an aisle could lose half its stock
     without a pixel of it changing, and then change all at once.

     THE FIRST FIX WAS ONE TEXEL PER SECTOR and it was the wrong picture,
     which the user reported as z-fighting. A sector's progress is one
     number, so every surface in it sooted together, and the sectors of
     this map are big axis-aligned rectangles: a burnt aisle met a clean
     cross-aisle along a dead-straight line, exactly vertical or exactly
     horizontal on screen, with a different texture and a different light
     on each side. That does not read as a fire. It reads as a fault.

     So the picture is the FIRE'S OWN GRID: 32-unit cells, the same ones
     it spreads through, one byte each, sampled here by WORLD POSITION
     with a linear filter. The soot front then creeps at the resolution
     the fire has and crosses a sector boundary without knowing it is
     there. It also answers the question better for the surfaces that are
     not floors — a wall reads the cells it stands in and a ceiling the
     cells under it, rather than whichever sector it was filed under.

     `burnOrigin` and `burnCell` are the grid's corner and pitch in world
     units, and `burnCols` by `burnRows` is its size in cells — which is
     also, exactly, the size of the texture, so the fetch divides by it
     and a position off the edge of the fire's world reads zero rather
     than the clamped edge. See Game.ticBurnGrid. */

   THE COALS ON A BURNT SURFACE

   A charred wall used to be a picture of embers: the ash and the little

   the exact moment the game most wants to look alive. The burning trees
   have never had that problem — their shader runs the eight-colour ember
   ramp against a clock — and this is the same maths, on the same ramp,
   on the same clock, so that a charred aisle and a charred fir are one
   fire going out rather than two effects that happen to be orange.

   world-space cells about five units across, kept only where the surface
   is ALREADY DARK. Coals live in the recesses of a burnt thing — the
   char between the boards, the gap between the studs — and a burnt
   texture's own dark places are exactly those recesses. So the texture
   picks the spots and the shader lights them.

   SOOT, WHICH ARRIVES BEFORE THE FIRE DOES

   The thing a burning shop does that this game was not drawing: it goes
   BLACK, gradually, in patches, starting at the corners and the joints,
   long before anything in it has actually burnt. Two texture swaps — one
   at half the region's fuel and one at nearly all of it — cannot say
   that, and the first half of every region's life was therefore
   invisible: an aisle lost half its stock without a pixel changing and
   then changed all at once.

   WHERE IT LANDS FIRST is a world-space field, two scales of it: cells
   about a shelf bay across decide which patches go early, and cells a
   few units across ragged the edge of each one. So the soot has a SHAPE
   of its own rather than a level of its own, and it spreads across a
   wall as the region's number climbs — the lowest-numbered cells first,
   joining up, until the wall is black. Nothing about it is per-region
   except the number, so two aisles burning at once are never in step,
   because they are not in the same place.

   AND THE EDGE CRAWLS, on the coals' own clock, which is what makes a
   wall halfway through catching still be doing something while you look
   at it. The advancing edge is also the only part of it that is HOT: a
   scorch mark is orange at its rim and dead black behind it, which is
   one line of arithmetic (the product of the amount and its complement,
   which peaks exactly where the boundary is) and is the difference
   between soot spreading and a texture fading.

   It costs nothing where nothing has burnt, which is most of the game
   and all of it until you do something.

     four fifths of every pixel and then puts pale ash over the top of
     it — deliberately, twice over, because a burnt store dark enough to

     this took the albedo to a fifth, which the room light then took to

       a = 1   the surface has no picture at all and vInk.rgb IS its
               colour — the second material, carried in the vertices
               rather than costing a second draw call
       a = 0   the surface has a picture, and vInk.rgb is what the WHITE
               PAINT in that picture is multiplied by

     THE SECOND SENSE IS HOW A CAR PARK GETS MORE THAN ONE COLOUR OF
     VAN. There is one model, one texture and one mesh for the whole lot
     — seventy-seven vehicles in a single draw call, which is the thing
     worth keeping — so a red van cannot be a different file or a
     different sheet. It has to be the same texel, multiplied.

     AND THE MASK IS READ OUT OF THE TEXEL ITSELF rather than painted
     into the sheet by hand. The van's own paint is white: bright and
     dead neutral. Everything that must NOT take the colour — the
     grille, the bumpers, the tyres, the glass — is far darker. So a
     luminance ramp with a saturation guard isolates the bodywork
     exactly, and it does it per TEXEL, which is the whole reason this
     looks like paint: every bit of shading the artist put in the sheet
     survives, so the shadowed flank of a blue van is dark blue and the
     lit roof is bright blue. Painting a flat colour over the body would
     have thrown all of that away.

     THE NUMBERS ARE IN LINEAR AND THAT IS THE WHOLE TRAP. The sheet is
     an sRGB texture and is decoded on the way out of texture2D, so what
     arrives here is NOT what a colour picker says about the PNG. The
     thresholds were first set off the file — paint at 0.75 to 0.94,
     ramp from 0.55 — and in linear the paint is 0.50 to 0.78, so the
     ramp caught only the brightest highlights: what came out was a
     white van with a red pinstripe down every edge, which is a good
     picture of getting a colour space wrong. Measured in linear, on the
     file: background 0.06, tyres and grille under 0.09, glass 0.28,
     the darkest shadowed paint 0.53, a lit panel 0.67, the roof 0.78.
     The ramp sits in the gap between the glass and the shadow.

     MULTIPLIED, NOT MIXED. White times red is red; light grey times red
     is a darker red. Which is what paint does.

     and leave a trail behind them, and with the drawing untouched
     underneath what the eye reads is a shopper standing BEHIND a fire.
     What makes it that person burning is that their own colours go.

     A MAP AND NOT A TINT, exactly as the ice is and for exactly the
     same reason: multiplying a green coat by orange gives a muddy
     brown coat, and what somebody on fire looks like is their SHAPE in
     flame. So the texel's luminance is kept, everything else is thrown
     away, and that one number picks a colour off the ember ramp — the
     same eight the coals in a burnt aisle use, so a person burning and
     the aisle they set light to are made of the same paint.

     HOTTEST AT THE FEET, because fire climbs: a person alight is white
     at the knees and their head is the last thing still recognisable.
     That gradient is also what keeps them readable as a PERSON for the
     four seconds they have left — a figure evenly washed to orange is
     a silhouette, and the whole point of them running is that you can
     see who it is running.

     AND THEY DARKEN UNDERNEATH IT. The base colour is taken down as
     the fire takes hold, so what is not actually alight at this
     instant is scorched cloth rather than a clean coat — and the
     flicker moves the line between the two about, which is the

     A PERSON BEING EATEN BY THE FIRE

     and run; they are consumed where they stand and collapse into a
     heap (see Actor.burnAway). This is the whole of what that looks
     like, and it is done in the shader rather than in art because
     seventeen shoppers times an animation of a person burning away is
     art nobody is going to draw, and because the drawing being EATEN —
     their own coat, their own shape, going — is the part that makes it
     read as that person rather than as an effect played over them.

     A FRONT, NOT A FADE. Every texel gets a threshold and the front is
     one number crossing all of them: below it the texel is gone,
     within a band of it the texel is a coal, and above it the texel is
     still there but scorched by the heat coming. Three zones, one
     comparison, and what sweeps across is a ragged edge of fire rather
     than a person turning transparent.

     FROM THE FEET UP, which is not arbitrary: the fire is on the floor
     and fire goes up. Seven parts of the threshold are height and three
     are noise, so the edge is level enough to read as a front and torn
     enough not to read as a wipe. Two scales of noise, the coarse one
     about the size of a hand, because one scale is a repeating pattern
     at this resolution.

     AND THE COALS ARE ADDED, NOT MULTIPLIED, for the same reason the
     ones on a burnt wall are: they are the only light on a dark thing
     in a dark room, and a multiplied coal is a coal you cannot see.

   `blend` is the one thing here that is not Doom. Doom had exactly one
   way of drawing a sprite — a cut-out, every pixel either there or not —
   and everything in this game that is a THING is drawn that way. Fire is
   not a thing. Two flames overlapping are brighter than one flame, which
   is the whole reason a fire reads as light rather than as orange
   wallpaper, and no amount of cut-out gets you there: it is the one
   effect that needs the frame buffer added to rather than replaced.
