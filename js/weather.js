/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the clock, the weather and the wind
   =====================================================================

   One state, read by everybody, so that the hour the sky says it is,
   the distance the air lets you see, the direction the smoke drifts
   and the rain that is falling on a burning car park are one fact and
   not four. See SIGHT.txt for why it is built this way.

   TIME OF DAY IS ONE NUMBER, the hour, and everything below is a table
   lookup on it: five or six keyframes across the night, interpolated.
   The judgement — what colour 05:10 is — lives in the table, in
   Javascript, where a headless test can read it. The shader gets
   uniforms and does arithmetic.

   THE GAME IS A NIGHT, so the clock is a night. It starts at two in the
   morning, which is the hour the game has always been set at, and runs
   at a rate that brings the sun up in about nine minutes of play — you
   have until dawn. A full day is more rows in the same table.

   WEATHER IS A ROW multiplied over the hour's row: how far the air lets
   you see (which is also the draw distance — see airFar), how much sky
   is left, whether there is cloud over the stars, whether it rains,
   and which way the wind blows.

   THE WIND WAS WIND_X = 0.28 in js/effects.js, read by three smoke
   emitters and nothing else, with a comment claiming the forest leaned
   with it. It is a vector here now, and the smoke, the rain, the
   store's fire and the wood's fire all read the same two numbers.

   COLOURS ARE WRITTEN AS BYTES — hex, the way anybody picks a colour —
   and are converted to linear where they go into a shader, because
   everything in this renderer's buffer is linear.

   The night, in keyframes

   sunAlt is the sun's altitude in degrees; below about -18 it does
   nothing, and the dawn is the last three rows. The moon is its own
   pair. `glow` is the light along the horizon on the sun's side, which
   at 05:10 is the whole dawn, and `town` is the sodium glow low in the
   west that any night sky near people has. `stars` and `milky` are how
   much of the starfield and the band across it survive the sky's own
   brightness. `skyLight` is what an outdoor surface is lit to by the
   sky alone — the vertex's own light is the floor and this lifts it —
   and `minLight` the darkest anything gets by distance.
