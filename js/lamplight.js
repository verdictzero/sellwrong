/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the street lamps' own light
   =====================================================================

   Every street lamp in the town is a photograph stood up in the map
   (THE STREET LAMP IS GEOMETRY, js/mapgeo.js), and a photograph of a
   lamp is a lamp that is off. This is the part that is on.

   WHAT A LAMP IS AT NIGHT, from across a street, is not a lit pole. It
   is a point of cold light with a line across it — the bloom of the
   luminaire, and the streak a bright source puts across a lens — and
   the pavement under it going pale. The pavement is the map's job: the
   pool sector, tinted by its own shader (vLamp in js/material.js). The
   point and the line are this file's: ONE ANAMORPHIC FLARE PER LAMP,
   drawn the way the gunship's searchlight is drawn in js/vtol.js and
   for the same reason — a flare is what you actually read a light by
   after dark — but small, and cold, and forty at a time.

   ONE MESH FOR ALL OF THEM. The gunship has one lamp and one Flare with
   a uniform for where it is; the town has four hundred, and four
   hundred meshes with four hundred uniform updates a frame is the
   crowd's problem all over again (see the culling note on Actor.render
   in js/actor.js). So the flares are one buffer of LAMP_SLOTS quads and
   the centre of each is an ATTRIBUTE rather than a uniform: every
   frame the nearest lamps that could be seen at all are dealt into the
   slots, their lens points and their glow are written into the buffer,
   and it is one draw call whether that is three lamps or forty.

   WHICH LAMPS. Cheapest test first: within LAMP_FAR; not well behind
   the eye; in a region the portal flood says is visible (the same
   Level.visibleSectors every sprite in the game defers to); then the
   nearest LAMP_SLOTS of what is left. And then the one that costs
   something — a SIGHT LINE from the eye to the lens, the same call a
   trooper uses to decide whether it can see you — so a lamp behind a
   house does not flare through the house. It is asked of a third of
   the slots each frame rather than all of them, and its answer is
   EASED onto over about a sixth of a second (the gunship flare's own
   figure), because a flare that pops off at a wall edge reads as the
   flare being broken rather than as the lamp going behind something.

   SUBTLE, AND IT FADES WITH DISTANCE, at the user's request. The
   gunship's flare is most of the frame across; this one is a fifth of
   it and thin, and its glow falls off as the square of the distance to
   nothing at LAMP_FAR — and its size is pulled in with it, so a lamp at
   the end of the street is a point with a hair across it and the one
   over your head is a lamp. Additive, over everything, no depth test:
   whether a wall is in the way is the sight line's answer, not the
   depth buffer's, for the reason at Flare in js/vtol.js.

   AND ONLY AFTER DARK. lampsOn is the same curve the pavement's shader
   runs on the sky's light — on as the sky goes under a half, full by a
   fifth — so the flare and the pool under it switch together, at dusk
   and at dawn, and in a storm dark enough to trip a photocell. The
   colour is LAMP_LIGHT from js/material.js, the same one the pavement
   is tinted by: mercury vapour, cold, with green in it.
