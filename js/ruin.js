/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — what is holding up a roof that is not there
   =====================================================================

   A REGION THAT HAS BURNT OUT USED TO BECOME SKY. Its ceiling texture
   was swapped for the one the engine treats as a hole, and what you got
   when you walked back through a gutted aisle and looked up was stars —
   a clean rectangular stars-shaped absence with a hard edge on it where
   the next aisle's ceiling was still up. Which is not what a burnt-out
   building looks like and, more to the point, is not what one IS. A shed
   this size is a steel frame with a deck on it. The DECK burns. The
   frame is what is still standing in the photograph the morning after,
   and it is the entire reason a burnt-out supermarket reads as a
   building rather than as a car park with walls.

   So there is framing up there now, at the user's request, and it is
   real geometry rather than a picture of some: joists across the span at
   a pitch, beams under them on the column lines, some of the joists
   sagging where the heat was worst and some of them simply gone, and a
   torn panel of deck still lying across a bay here and there.

   THE ROOF IS ONE ROOF, and that is the thing this file exists to get
   right. The fire guts REGIONS — an aisle at a time, a gondola at a time
   — so the obvious way to build this is per region, and the obvious way
   is wrong: two aisles either side of a gutted gondola would each get
   their own joists, at their own offsets, meeting the shelf between them
   at nothing in particular. What is drawn instead is one LATTICE over
   the whole world, and a region draws the piece of it that falls inside
   its own outline. A joist that runs across three regions is one joist
   in three pieces, at one height, sagging by one amount, and where the
   region next door still has its ceiling the joist simply stops — which
   is exactly what you see from underneath, because the ceiling is in the
   way.

   EVERYTHING IS A FUNCTION OF WHERE IT IS. Which joists sag, which are
   missing, where the beams fall, how much a joist droops at a given x —
   all of it is a hash or a curve over the world coordinate, never a
   random number drawn at build time. That is what makes the lattice
   agree with itself across regions, and it is also what makes a rebuild
   — and there are twenty of them in a level, every time another region
   finishes burning — put the same steel back in the same place.

   IT COSTS ABOUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. A member is a box: six quads,
   twelve triangles, one texture, and it goes into the same batch as
   every other piece of steel in the building, so the whole ruined roof
   of a fully burnt store is one draw call and something like fifteen
   thousand triangles — about two thirds of what the car park costs.

   AND WHEN IT HAS COME DOWN

   The frame above is what is standing the morning after. This is what is
   there when it is not — when the steel has been in the fire long enough
   to let go, or when something took the wall out from under it. See AND
   WHAT IS STILL HOLDING IT UP in js/fire.js for which of those happened
   and when.

   A HEAP IS THE SAME LATTICE, LYING DOWN. Everything the roof was is
   still in the region, it is just on the floor: the joists that ran east
   to west are lying east to west, broken where they folded, and the deck
   that was on them is in sheets between them. Which is why this is not a
   pile of random boxes — it is the frame above, drawn at ankle height,
   off the same hash of the same lattice index. A joist that had already
   sagged fell first and lies flattest; one that was still straight came
   down in two pieces. Two collapsed bays next to each other share their
   heap for the same reason they shared their roof.

   AND IT IS LOW IN THE MIDDLE AND BANKED AT THE EDGES, which is both
   what a collapse does — the floor pushes the debris out, the walls stop
   it — and the only way to draw a heap you can walk over without drawing
   one you walk THROUGH. The middle of a region is the part you cross, so
   nothing there stands higher than the step the floor already rose by.
   The drifts are against the walls, where the only thing you could do is
   stand on them.

   IT IS STILL ALIGHT. Every piece is drawn fully charred, which is what
   puts live coals in the seams — see the note on the shader in
   js/material.js — so a collapsed bay is not a grey heap, it is a black
   one with orange in it, and it stays that way for the rest of the
   night.

   AND A TUNNEL OF DEBRIS ROUND A HOLE
   =====================================================================

   At the user's request. js/breach.js takes a rectangle out of a wall
   and the wall is then a wall with a rectangle missing — which is
   exactly what it is, and reads as a wall with a rectangle missing. A
   sheet of card with a shape cut out of it. What the lance actually did
   was BORE through a structure, and a bored hole has a thickness: the
   edge of it is broken material, some of it fallen inward, some of it
   thrown out the far side, all of it still smoking.

   So every breach gets a ring of chunks round its perimeter, standing
   proud of the wall on BOTH sides along the line the beam took. Seen
   from in front it is a ragged burnt lip. Seen from an angle it is a
   short tunnel. Walk through it and the chunks pass either side of you,
   which is the whole point: a wall in this engine has no thickness and
   this is how it gets one, for the eighty units either side of a hole
   where anybody is going to be looking closely.

   IT IS BUILT WITH THE WALL IT BELONGS TO. rebuildBlock walks the lines
   of a block and calls this for any that have holes, so the debris
   lands in the same BatchSet as the brick around it — one more draw
   call for a whole street's worth of it, and it rebuilds and disappears
   in step with the hole as that hole crumbles wider.

   ORIENTED, NOT AXIS-ALIGNED. The other two builders in this file put
   down boxes squared to the map, because a joist in a supermarket is
   squared to the map. A wall is at whatever angle the town laid it, so
   a chunk broken off one is at that angle too, and the box below is
   built from three arbitrary vectors rather than from six numbers.
