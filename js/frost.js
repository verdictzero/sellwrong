/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the cold
   =====================================================================

   What comes out of the extinguisher, and it is the flamethrower's
   stream built the other way up. Same shape of thing — a few particles a
   tic leaving the nozzle at speed, slowing in the air, landing on
   something — and the opposite verb at every step: it takes heat OUT of
   the fuel grid, it puts trees back, and what it does to a person is
   hold them rather than kill them.

   WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE AND NOT A FLAG ON js/flame.js. The two
   share their arithmetic and disagree about everything else, and the
   moment one function has an `if (cold)` in six places it is two
   functions wearing a coat. The thirty lines of ballistics they have in
   common are thirty lines.

   THE NUMBERS ARE PER TIC, like everything else in the game.

     A GAS JET IS NOT A LIQUID JET, which is the one place the physics
     genuinely differ. Fuel from a flamethrower is thrown and falls;
     CO2 leaves at higher speed, loses it far faster, and then SINKS,
     because cold gas is heavier than the air around it. So the drag is
     harsher and the gravity is stronger, and the practical consequence
     is a weapon with less reach than the flamethrower that pools along
     the floor where it lands — which is what you want from it, because
     what you are aiming at is usually a fire on the ground.

   WHAT IT CANNOT DO IS UNDO ANYTHING. Fuel that has burned is burned;
   `burntFuel` only goes up and a charred aisle stays charred. Putting a
   fire out saves what has not caught YET, which makes this a tool for
   drawing firebreaks and for taking back a room, and never a way of
   winding the night backwards. See FireSystem.douse.
