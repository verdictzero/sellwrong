/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — fire
   =====================================================================

   The store burning down is the game. Everything else — the zombies, the
   weapons, the layout — exists to make burning it down interesting. So
   the fire is not an effect painted over the level, it is a simulation
   running underneath it, and the level is built out of things that feed
   it.

   A GRID OF FUEL. Thirty-two units to a cell, laid over the whole map.
   Each cell knows how much there is to burn there, taken from the sector
   it sits in — a shelf of stock is worth a great deal, bare lino almost
   nothing, and the car park nothing at all. Fire spreads between
   neighbouring cells, consumes the fuel, and leaves the cell dead.

   WHAT MAKES IT A GAME AND NOT A SCREENSAVER is that the fuel is laid
   out the way a supermarket is: dense in the aisles, dense in the
   stockroom, and THIN in the walkways between them. So a fire in one
   aisle will happily eat that aisle and then stop at the cross-aisle,
   and burning the place down means deliberately carrying fire across the
   gaps. That is the whole game loop, and it falls out of the map having
   been drawn like a shop.

   WHAT FIRE CAN CROSS. A one-sided line is a wall and stops it dead. A
   two-sided line is a gap in something, and fire goes through gaps —
   under a shelf, over a counter, through a doorway. The only two-sided
   line that stops it is one whose opening has closed, which is to say a
   shut door. Worked out once at startup and stored as four bits a cell,
   because doing it per spread would be thousands of segment
   intersections a second.

   HEAT RISES AND FALLS. A cell that catches does not go instantly to
   maximum; it builds, peaks, and dies back as its fuel runs out. That
   curve is why a fire has a visible FRONT — a bright edge advancing into
   fresh stock with a dimming trail of embers behind it — instead of
   being a uniformly glowing region that grows.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------
   The shape of one cell's life

   Heat runs 0..255. A cell that catches climbs toward a peak, holds
   while it has fuel, and dies back to nothing once the fuel is gone.
   That curve is why a fire has a visible FRONT — a bright edge advancing
   into fresh stock, with a dimming trail of embers behind it — instead
   of being a uniformly glowing region that grows.

   NO FIRE SURVIVES ITSELF, and that is the requirement now. It is a
   statement about percolation rather than about flammability. A fire
   crossing a region carries on only if each burning cell lights, on
   average, MORE THAN ONE new one before it burns out:

     expected spreads  =  tics alight  x  chance  x  neighbours

   Above one, the fire runs away and takes everything connected to it,
   and no player is required. Below one it peters out, and no amount of
   waiting brings it back, because a burnt cell has no fuel left to
   relight. There is no middle setting — it either eventually takes the
   store on its own or it never does.

   IT USED TO BE ABOVE ONE EVERYWHERE, which meant one match anywhere in
   the building took between eighty-five and ninety-four per cent of the
   shop with nobody in it. That was the design and it was asked for, and
   then it was asked for the other way round: a fire the player has to
   WORK at. So every number below is now under the line, and what a fire
   does when you leave it alone is go out.

   What that buys, and it is the whole game loop:

     A MATCH IS A PATCH. One ignition in the richest stock in the
       building takes twenty-odd cells — five metres across — over a
       couple of minutes, and then it is out. Two tenths of one per cent
       of the store.
     A WALKWAY IS A WALL. Bare floor is sixty times less willing to pass
       fire on than a gondola, which puts it so far under the line that
       fire does not cross an aisle at all. The cross-aisles are real
       firebreaks now rather than slow ones.
     THE SHELVES ARE THE FUSE. Dense stock is still the most willing
       thing in the building, so pouring along a run does take the run.
       It simply will not jump to the next one.

   So burning the place down is a job of work: you point the gun at the
   shelving, and the shelving you pointed at is what burns. A full sweep
   of the shop still reaches a hundred per cent, everything charred and
   everything gutted — that was measured, not hoped — but it takes the
   player walking every aisle of it, which is the point.

   The car park is the exception and stays the exception: fuel 0, no
   burning, ever. It is the safe room and the way out.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------ */
/* How often the simulation steps, in game tics. This is the pace
   control, and it is deliberately separate from every other number here.

   Slowing the CLOCK slows the fire without touching the percolation
   maths at all — the expected-spreads-per-cell figure above is counted
   in FIRE tics, so it is identical at any interval. That is what makes
   the two halves of "slower, and it should go out" separable: this
   number decides HOW FAST, and SPREAD_RICH decides HOW FAR. Turn the
   wrong one and you get a fire that is sluggish and still unstoppable,
   or brisk and already over.

   It has been 2, 6, 18 and 3, in that order, each time because somebody
   watched it and said faster or slower. At 2 one match took the whole
   store in 34 seconds and there was nothing for the player to do; at 3
   a run of shelving flashed over while you were still standing in the
   aisle.

   IT IS 10 BECAUSE MUCH SLOWER WAS ASKED FOR THREE TIMES IN ONE
   SENTENCE, and the clock is the honest place to spend that, for the
   reason directly above: the interval buys pace and nothing else. The
   other half of the same request — that a fire should go OUT — is not
   here and cannot be here, because a slower clock makes a runaway fire
   take longer and still take everything. That half is SPREAD_RICH.

   What it feels like: a fire front creeps about one cell every twelve
   seconds through dense stock, where it used to manage six cells a
   second, and a gondola cell rises, roars and is spent in a quarter of a
   minute. The ember tail behind the front is counted in fire tics too,
   so it came UP with the clock and a burnt-out patch sits glowing for
   the better part of a minute before it goes cold — which is what you
   want when the fire is the slow thing: the ground you have taken should
   stay visibly taken while you are off taking the next bit. */

/* Fraction of a cell's ORIGINAL fuel consumed per fire tic at full heat.
   Making it a fraction rather than a flat rate is what gives every cell
   a roughly similar LIFETIME however rich it is — which is what keeps
   thin fuel alight long enough to matter.

   AND THIN FUEL IS SLOWER STILL, so a cell of bare floor smoulders for
   the better part of three minutes while a gondola is spent in a
   quarter of one. That long life used to be what carried fire across a
   walkway — a cell that stays alight gets more rolls to pass itself on,
   and the two terms multiply:

     expected spreads  =  tics alight  x  chance  x  neighbours

   It is deliberately still long, and the chance is what came down
   instead. The floor smoulders for minutes and gets nowhere, which is
   exactly the picture wanted: a fire lying on the lino, visibly alight,
   visibly not going anywhere, until it gives up.

   This is why the fuel arrays are floats. At the old rate a lino cell
   ate `max(1, ...)` of its fifty-five units a tic, and that floor — one
   whole unit, because the array was integers — WAS the burn rate for
   everything thin. Nothing under one could be expressed. */

   A cell whose fuel is spent used to fade to nothing in a couple of
   seconds, so an aisle you had just burnt out looked exactly like an
   aisle nobody had touched — which made the fire feel like an animation
   playing over the level rather than something happening to it. Now it
   drops to a low glow and sits there before going cold, so the ground
   you have taken stays visibly taken.

   In FIRE tics, so what this is in seconds is whatever the clock above
   says: a dozen or so at an interval of 3, and it was a minute and a
   quarter when the interval was 18. That is the right coupling and not
   an accident of units — the glow behind the front should be a fixed

   sky through where the ceiling was. So this is deliberately near the
   end of a region's fuel rather than halfway: everything in it has to
   have burnt, not just most of it, or the store starts losing its roof
   while there is still stock on the shelves.

/* =====================================================================
   AND WHAT IS STILL HOLDING IT UP

   CHARRED IS A SURFACE, GUTTED IS A STRUCTURE, AND COLLAPSED IS NEITHER
   — it is the absence of one. The three stages are the same building
   three times: a shop with everything in it blackened, a shell with the
   deck gone and the steel showing, and then a heap.

   THE THIRD STAGE NEEDED A CLOCK THAT THE FIRST TWO DID NOT. Those two
   run off `sectorBurnt / sectorFuel` — how much of what was in a region
   has gone — and that number saturates at one and stops. A gutted region
   has nothing left to burn, so as far as the old arithmetic is concerned
   nothing further can happen to it, and a burnt-out shed stands for ever.

   Steel does not care how much has burnt. It cares how LONG it has been
   hot — a fire brigade's whole judgement about whether to go into a
   building is that question — so INTEGRITY is a clock and not a
   quantity: one when the frame is whole, zero when it is on the floor,
   and falling for as long as there is fire AT the region.

   AT, AND NOT IN, WHICH IS THE WHOLE TRICK. A gutted region has very
   little left to burn by definition, so a clock that watched only its
   own cells would run for the few seconds of its last eight per cent and
   then stop. What cooks the steel over aisle six is the fire in aisle
   five. So a hot cell credits its own region AND every region it is
   LINKED to — which through a wall is nothing and across an open aisle
   is everything — and a bay only comes down while the building around it
   is still going.

   THE FIRST CUT OF THIS RE-FUELLED A GUTTED REGION instead, on the
   reasoning that a burnt-out building is full of burning deck. It is,
   and it was still the wrong mechanism: fuel put back above the
   threshold a cell needs to light its neighbour means a ruin relights
   the room next door, which relights it back, and the fire stops being
   something you set and becomes something that cannot be stopped. The
   sign it was wrong was not in this file — it was the police, who could
   no longer keep a van in the car park long enough to get out of it. A
   clock adds nothing to the world. That is the point of it.

   The two consequences are the ones worth having. A shop that burns from
   end to end comes down, a bay at a time, in the order it burnt. And a
   region at the EDGE of a fire — one that gutted and then had the fire
   move away from it, or had the rain put it out — stands as a ruin,
   because nothing kept cooking it. Which side of that line a bay falls
   is not a coin flip anywhere in this file; it is where the fire went.

       shader samples by position (see THE PICTURE in js/game.js). It used

       that was written when the grid was the supermarket: 225 by 207,
       forty-six thousand cells, a fraction of a millisecond. The town
       made it 605 by 810 — four hundred and ninety thousand — and nobody

       tics, to find the twenty that moved, and it cost two thirds of
       every tic in the game whether or not anything was alight.

     AND PUTTING ONE OUT

     The opposite operation, and it is not symmetrical with ignite, which
     is the interesting part. Fire is a THRESHOLD system — a cell spreads
     at SPREAD_AT and dies below EMBER_HEAT — so taking heat away is not
     undoing damage, it is moving a cell across a line. Drop one under
     SPREAD_AT and it stops recruiting its neighbours; drop it to nothing
     and it is out, and the front behind it starves.

     WHAT IT CANNOT DO IS PUT THE FUEL BACK. A shelf that has burned is
     burned: `burntFuel` only goes up, a charred region stays charred,
     and a region that has gone will not come back because somebody
     sprayed it. So the extinguisher is not an undo button — it is a
     firebreak you can draw with, and the thing it saves is whatever has
     not caught YET.

     EMBERS GO TOO, and this is the difference between a fire that is out
     and a fire that is sulking. A cell with fuel gone sits at a glow for
     EMBER_TICS and will relight anything that wanders past; a doused one
     has its ember clock cleared, so the aisle behind you stays dark.

     AND THE THIRD WAY TO BRING A BUILDING DOWN, WHICH IS A LINE

     Fire is patient, a blast is a circle, and the positron lance is a
     CYLINDER: a column of light a couple of metres across drawn from
     the muzzle to the far side of the map, and everything standing in
     it stops standing. See js/beam.js, which owns the beam; this owns
     the grid, so this is where the walk lives — the same argument
     damageStructure makes about the blast circle, said about a swept
     one.

     WALKED IN THE LINE'S OWN FRAME. A cell's place is turned into two
     numbers: `s`, how far along the ground track it lies, and `off`,
     how far to the side of it. `off` decides whether the cell is in the
     column at all and how hard it is hit; `s` decides how HIGH the beam
     is over that cell, which is the part a circle never has to think
     about. A shot fired level from the eye passes through ground floors
     for its whole length; one fired up the road at ten degrees is
     through the bedrooms by the end of the street and over the roofs
     after that, and this is the arithmetic that makes those two
     different.

     EVERY STOREY THE COLUMN TOUCHES, not the one it is aimed at. The
     column has a radius and a storey has a height, and at the widest
     stage the first is bigger than the second — so a level shot through
     a house takes the bedroom with the front room, because it does.

     THE NEAREST POINT OF A REGION DECIDES ITS BITE, exactly as in
     damageStructure and for the same reason: a region clipped by the
     edge of the column is grazed and one straddling the middle is cut,
     and averaging the cells in between would say neither.

     @param from    { x, y, z } the muzzle, in game coordinates
     @param angle   which way, and `slope` the rise per unit travelled
     @param range   how far along the ground track to walk
     @param radius  the column's own radius
     @param amount  integrity off a region at the centre of the column
     @returns how many regions came down

    /* MARCHED ALONG THE LINE, NOT SCANNED OVER ITS BOX, and the
       difference is a factor of sixty.

       The obvious walk is the blast's: take the rectangle that bounds
       the shape and test every cell in it. For a circle that is four
       cells wasted in nine. For a segment eight thousand units long and
       two hundred and sixty wide, laid diagonally, the bounding box is
       eight thousand SQUARE — the whole town, a quarter of a million
       cells, to find the two thousand that are actually under the beam.
       Twelve times a second, for five seconds.

       So this marches: half a cell at a time along the line, and half a
       cell at a time across it out to the radius. Half, because a cell
       is CELL across and a step of CELL could straddle two of them and
       land in neither — at CELL/2 every cell the column covers is
       stepped into at least once. Cells near the middle are stepped
       into several times, which costs nothing: `seen` keeps the biggest
       bite a region took and a repeat is one map lookup.

     Drawing

     Two fixed pools of quads — flames and the smoke over them — parked
     on the hottest cells near the player each frame. There is no
     per-cell sprite object and nothing is created or destroyed while the
     store burns: with a whole aisle alight that would be hundreds of
     allocations a second for something nobody can distinguish from a
     hundred and sixty well-placed ones.

     WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY EACH PART OF IT

     ADDITIVE. One quad per cell, alpha-tested, gave a fire made of
     visible tiles: every flame was a hard-edged orange shape sitting in
     front of the next one, and two of them overlapping were no brighter
     than one. Fire does not work like that — light adds — and it is the
     adding that makes a mass of flame read as a source of light rather
     than as a picture of some flames. So the flame material is additive
     and writes no depth, and the soft edge that js/fireart.js always
     drew and the alpha test always threw away is finally being used for
     something.

     A CLUMP, NOT A FLAME. One sprite per cell puts one flame every
     thirty-two units on a grid, and a grid is exactly what you saw. Each
     cell now gets between one and three, scattered inside it and a
     little past it, at offsets hashed off the cell index and the slot —
     so the scatter is RANDOM but it is the SAME random every frame, and
     the fire does not boil. Everything that moves in it moves because
     the flame art is animating.

     BIG IN THE MIDDLE, SMALL AT THE EDGE. `core` is how surrounded by
     heat a cell is: the mean of its four neighbours' heat. A cell in the
     middle of a burning gondola has hot neighbours in every direction
     and gets three big flames off the top of the ladder; a cell on the
     advancing front has cold ones and gets a single small one. That is
     the shape of a real fire — a bright body with a ragged fringe — and
     it falls out of a number the simulation already has, so it costs
     four array reads. It picks the SET as well as the scale: the outer
     members of a clump come off the size below, so a small flame is
     genuinely a smaller drawing rather than a big one shrunk.

     AND SMOKE. See sprites.js for the art. It is parked over the cells
     with the highest core, at a height that rises with it, alpha-blended
     and NOT fullbright — so the one fire light in the game lights it
     from underneath, which is the whole look of smoke over a fire.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------ */
  /* Built on the first frame that draws, not in the constructor. The
     simulation is pure — a fuel grid and some integers — and coupling it
