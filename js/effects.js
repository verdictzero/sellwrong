   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — embers and smoke
   =====================================================================

   A fire that only glows is a picture of a fire. What sells it is what
   comes OFF it: sparks lifting on the heat and going out, and smoke
   standing up over it and drifting away. Both are cheap if they are
   budgeted, and this is the budget: a few hundred embers and a couple
   of hundred puffs at most, alive at once, in two draw calls.

   WHERE THEY COME FROM. Nothing spawns from every burning cell — with
   an aisle alight that is hundreds of sources and with a forest alight
   it is thousands. Each tic a handful of burning cells NEAR THE PLAYER
   are sampled at random, from the store's grid and from the forest's,
   and those throw the frame's sparks. Far fires are a glow on the
   horizon anyway; a spark two thousand units off is a pixel nobody
   sees, and it would have cost the same as one at your feet.

   EMBERS are cutout quads a couple of units across, bright gold going
   to dark coal, lifted by the heat and then falling, and they die when
   they land. SMOKE is a soft blob, alpha-blended, that grows and fades
   as it climbs; it is lit by the sector light like anything else, so it
   is dark against the night and catches the fire glow from below.

   A PERSON ON FIRE

   The best thing in this game was, until now, invisible. A shopper the
   flame touches catches, runs for several seconds dropping fire behind
   them and then goes off — and what you SAW was an ordinary shopper,
   drawn fullbright, with some fire on the floor near them. The whole
   mechanic was carried by the floor.

   THREE THINGS MAKE SOMEBODY LOOK ALIGHT and it needs all three:

     THE FLAME ON THEM       licks spawned at the body every tic, short
                             lived, rising. Because they are PARTICLES
                             and the person is moving eight units a tic,
                             the ones behind are the trail — the same
                             pool does the fire and the tail of it, and
                             a burning shopper who stops running piles
                             them up on the spot instead, which is
                             correct and costs nothing.
     THE SPRITE ITSELF       a fire colour map on the drawing, the same
                             trick as the ice: see `alight` in
                             js/material.js. Flames in front of an
                             unchanged shopper read as a shopper
                             standing behind a fire.
     THE LIGHT THEY THROW    a burning person running down a dark aisle
                             lights it, and the store has exactly one
                             fire light (js/fire.js), so they pull it
                             toward themselves like everything else that
                             burns.

   AND IT IS BUDGETED, because a crowd fire is dozens of them at once
   and the aisle is already full of the fire's own flames. Nobody more
   than `near` away throws anything at all — at that range they are two
   pixels and a glow — and no more than `most` of them in any one tic.
   ===================================================================== */
/* TONGUES, NOT A BONFIRE. The first cut threw two a tic at up to
   thirty-four units, which on a fifty-six-unit person is thirty
   overlapping blobs each a third of their height: what came out was a
   column of fire with somebody lost inside it, and the point of a
   burning shopper is that you can see WHO is burning. One a tic, smaller,
   and gone sooner — about a dozen alive on one person — leaves the
   drawing showing through, which is where the colour map does its work. */
