/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the game
   =====================================================================

   Holds the level, the actors, the fire and the player, and runs the
   world at a fixed 35 Hz whatever the renderer is doing.

   THE FIXED TIMESTEP IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. Every duration in the state
   tables is in tics; every movement constant is per tic. Run the world
   off the frame time and a monster's walk cycle changes speed with the
   framerate, a door opens faster on a better machine, and the physics
   constants stop meaning what they say. So the frame time goes into an
   accumulator and the world steps in whole tics, with the leftover
   carried forward. The RENDERER can run at whatever rate it likes; the
   world runs at 35, on every machine, for ever.

   The catch-up is capped at six tics. A tab that has been in the
   background for a minute should not try to simulate a minute of
   supermarket the instant it comes back.

     A PHYSICAL BLOW

     THERE IS NO WEAPON BEHIND THIS YET, and it is written anyway. A
     thing that hits people is coming — a bat, a hammer, whatever it
     turns out to be — and the half of it that is hard is not the art or
     the animation, it is the question of what a swing MEANS to the rest
     of the game. That question has an answer now, it is tested, and
     when the weapon arrives it calls one function.

     WHAT A SWING IS, here: a short reach, a wide arc, the nearest thing
     in it, and a direction. The first three are the boxcutter's melee
     already (see Player.meleeSwing, which is the same shape); the
     direction is the new part and the reason this is not just melee
     with a bigger number. A blow has a WAY it went, and the pieces go
     with it — Giblets.shatter throws the shards in a cone along it.

     AND IT IS AIMED AT THE ICE. Actor.damage already turns anything
     that is not fire into a shatter, so this needed no special case to
     break somebody frozen: it needed to carry the swing through so
     that breaking them LOOKS like being hit rather than like coming
     apart on its own. That is the whole delta, and it is the thing a
     weapon cannot add from outside.

     WHAT IT DOES NOT DO is push anybody. Actors in this game have no
     momentum — they move by tryWalk, a whole step or none of it, which
     is Doom's and is what stops a crowd oozing through a gap a person
     could not. Knocking a shopper across an aisle would be a physics
     system, not a parameter, so a blow that does not kill leaves them
     standing and cross. The player DOES get shoved, because Player has
     momx/momy and Player.damage already spends it.

     `count` is how many things one swing reaches. One is a bat; three
     is a swing through a queue of people who are all made of ice, and
     that is a decision for whoever builds the weapon rather than one
     to make here.

     HOW BURNT EVERY PIECE OF FLOOR IS, as a picture

     THIS USED TO BE ONE TEXEL PER SECTOR and that was the bug the user
     reported as z-fighting. A region's progress is a single number, so
     every surface in a sector sooted at once, and this map's sectors are
     big axis-aligned rectangles: a burnt aisle met a clean cross-aisle
     along a dead-straight line with a different texture and a different
     light level on either side of it. A knife edge across the floor,
     exactly vertical or exactly horizontal on screen, which reads as two
     surfaces fighting rather than as a fire.

     So the picture is the FIRE'S OWN GRID instead — 32-unit cells, the
     same ones the fire actually spreads through — sampled by world
     position with a linear filter, so the soot front creeps across the
     floor at the resolution the fire has and crosses a sector boundary
     without knowing it is there. A wall reads the cells it stands in and
     a ceiling the cells under it, which is also more nearly true than
     "the sector this surface was filed under".

     ONE BYTE A CELL AND NOT FOUR, in a texture the exact size of the
     grid rather than the power of two over it. Both of those were free
     and neither was: this was written as RGBA with the same value in r,
     g and b, in a square big enough to hold a 225 by 207 supermarket —
     256 square, 256K, and the sentence above it said 64K because it
     counted texels and not bytes. The town's grid is 605 by 810, which
     rounded up to 1024 square and FOUR MEGABYTES, and three.js has no
     way to upload part of a texture, so every tic on which one cell
     moved sent all four of them to the GPU. At thirty-five tics that is
     a hundred and forty megabytes a second to say that a shelf is
     sooty. It is 605 by 810 single channel now — 478K, which is a
     factor of nine — and it goes up at most every UPLOAD_EVERY tics,
     which the eye cannot tell from every tic because what it is drawing
     is a stain spreading across a floor.

     NPOT AND SINGLE CHANNEL ARE BOTH SAFE HERE and js/forest.js is the
     precedent: its own mask is a RedFormat DataTexture at the size of
     its grid. Neither needs mipmaps and neither wraps, which is the
     whole of what a non-power-of-two texture cannot do.
