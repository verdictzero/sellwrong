/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the lo-fi pipeline
   =====================================================================

   The whole game is drawn into a buffer, filtered down onto a grid of
   chunky pixels, and thrown at the screen with no smoothing whatsoever.
   Everything else in here follows from that.

   THOSE ARE TWO SIZES AND THEY USED TO BE ONE. For most of this
   project's life there was a single number — the buffer's height — and
   it answered two questions at once: how much detail the world is drawn
   with, and how big a pixel is. Which is how it worked in 1993, because
   the buffer WAS the screen, and it is a bad control because the two
   answers pull opposite ways. Turn it up for a sharper picture and the
   pixels vanish; turn it down for the pixels and the far end of the shop
   turns to mush. There is no setting at which the store is legible AND
   the picture is made of visible squares, which is the look.

   So there are two now:

     RENDER  the size of the buffer the world is rasterised into. This
             is the detail control and it is where the frame rate goes:
             halving it quarters the pixels being shaded.

     PIXELS  the size of the grid that buffer is filtered down onto,
             which is what you actually see. This is the LOOK control
             and it is nearly free — the filter runs once per chunky
             pixel, not once per screen pixel.

   AND FILTERED DOWN MEANS AVERAGED, which is the entire reason the two
   are worth separating. Point-sampling a 600-row buffer onto a 200-row
   grid picks one row in three and throws the rest away, and the result
   is a 200-row picture that cost three times as much — the two controls
   would be one control again, wearing a hat. Averaging each block
   instead spends that extra buffer on the CONTENT of the chunky pixel:
   an edge that falls two thirds of the way across a block comes out two
   thirds of the way between the two colours. A 320x200 picture with
   every square correct to an eighth of itself is a thing no 1993 machine
   could draw and it is what the setting is for.

   WHY A FIXED HEIGHT AND NOT A FIXED SIZE, for both of them. Doom was
   320x200 on a 4:3 monitor, which nobody has any more. Lock the width
   too and a modern window gets black bars down both sides; let both
   float and the game gets sharper on a bigger monitor, which is the
   exact opposite of the point. So the heights are fixed and the widths
   follow the window's shape. The camera's field of view is vertical, so
   a wider window shows you MORE STORE rather than the same store
   stretched, which is how a widescreen port ought to behave.

   AND THE PIXELS NEED NOT BE SQUARE. 320x200 filling a 4:3 monitor is
   not a square-pixel mode and never was: each pixel stood five wide to
   six tall, and every Doom sprite was drawn by somebody looking at that
   screen. A square-pixel 320x200 is a squashed Doom. So the grid takes a
   PIXEL ASPECT — the width of one chunky pixel over its height, as
   displayed — and the grid's width is the window's shape divided by it.
   Ask for 5:6 on a 4:3 window at two hundred rows and you get 320x200,
   which is not a coincidence and is the whole of the arithmetic.

   NOTHING ABOUT THE WORLD MOVES WHEN THAT CHANGES. The camera's aspect
   is the BUFFER's, and the buffer's pixels are always square; the grid
   is a quantisation laid over the finished frame, and quantising a frame
   anisotropically does not stretch what is in it. So a tall-pixel
   picture shows exactly the same store as a square-pixel one, in taller
   squares.

   WHY THE HUD AND THE GUN GO IN THE SAME BUFFER. If the numbers and the
   weapon in your hands are drawn at native resolution over a chunky
   world, the whole illusion collapses — you get a crisp modern overlay
   sitting on a retro photograph. So every overlay scene renders into the
   same buffer and goes through the same filter. There can be several:
   the flamethrower is a 3D model with its own perspective camera, the
   readout is a flat quad with an orthographic one, and they draw in
   order, each clearing depth so it lands over whatever came before.

   THE HUD IS LAID OUT IN CHUNKY PIXELS, not in buffer pixels, which is
   what keeps it the same size on screen when the RENDER control moves.
   Its camera is orthographic, so its extents are a unit of measure
   rather than a resolution: give it the grid's size and a six-pixel
   glyph is six CHUNKY pixels at any buffer size. At an integer ratio the
   block average puts each of its texels back exactly, so the readout
   comes out of a 600-row buffer bit-for-bit identical to the one drawn
   straight into a 200-row one.

   THE ORDER MATTERS. Average, then dither, then snap. Dithering after
   the snap would just put colours back that the palette does not
   contain. Dither first and the error the snap is about to make gets
   spread into a fine checker instead of a hard band, which is how a
   256-colour gradient ever looked like a gradient — and it is dithered
   ON THE GRID, one threshold per chunky pixel, because a checker finer
   than the pixels is a checker the averaging has already eaten.

   WHICH FIXED SOMETHING NOBODY HAD NOTICED. The old pass ran at SCREEN
   resolution and worked out the Bayer index as floor(vUv * bufferSize)
   — the buffer texel this screen pixel is standing on. That is the right
   quantity and it was not always the right ANSWER: the hardware's
   nearest fetch does its own floor of the same product, in its own
   arithmetic, and on a 600-row window over a 400-row buffer that product
   lands on a whole number every other row. Where the two floors fell
   either side of it, a row of pixels got its neighbour's threshold. It
   was a row of dither one step out on a 256-colour picture, which is why
   it survived: nobody can see it, and diffing the frame with the dither
   turned off is what proves it was ever there. Computing both at grid
   fragment centres makes them the same number by construction.

   THREE PASSES, AND IT IS CHEAPER THAN THE TWO IT REPLACED. World into
   the buffer; buffer into the grid, averaged and dithered and snapped;
   grid onto the screen, nearest, no arithmetic at all. The palette
   search used to run once per SCREEN pixel — two million of them on a
   1080p monitor — and now runs once per chunky pixel, which at 320x200
   is sixty-four thousand.
