/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the screen on the back of the gun
   =====================================================================

   THE LANCE CAME WITH A SCREEN IN IT. The model the user brought in —
   Vaportrash's WZBR-1 Positron Sniper Lance — has four meshes, and two
   of them are not metal: a node named `dynamic_display_surface_1`, an
   eighty-millimetre panel on the rear deck facing straight back at
   whoever is holding it, and `optics_2`, a green lens up front. The
   author put the answer in the file the way the minigun's author put a
   marker cylinder in his. Everything below is what that node is for.

   WHAT IS ON IT: the world, live, through a second camera at the
   player's own eye with a narrow field of view — a camera-to-texture
   feed and not a painted picture — with round gauges over it for the
   charge, the hold and the cell, and a reticle in the middle. It is a
   sniper scope that happens to be a monitor, which is what a lance
   with a flat panel where the optics should be IS.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHY THE FEED IS ITS OWN RENDER AND NOT A CORNER OF THE MAIN ONE

   A zoomed picture is a DIFFERENT picture, not a crop: eight times the
   magnification is eight times fewer degrees across the same texels, and
   there is no way to get that out of a frame drawn at sixty degrees
   except by drawing it again. So this owns a second perspective camera,
   parked at the world camera's position with the world camera's
   rotation and a field of view divided by the magnification, and one
   more render() of the same scene into a small square target.

   THE SAME SCENE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE TRICK. Nothing is duplicated and
   nothing is kept in sync: the crowd, the fire, the town and the sky
   are whatever the frame already made them, and the feed is a second
   look at the one scene graph from the one place the player is standing.
   Everything the game culls for the main camera — the portal flood, the
   distance cuts in Actor.render, the geometry LOD — was computed from
   that same standpoint, so a narrower camera at the same point can only
   ever want a SUBSET of what is already there. There is no case where
   the scope wants something the frame threw away.

   AND IT IS SMALL AND SLOW ON PURPOSE. SIZE texels square — the panel
   is very nearly square, so the target is — and at most every EVERY-th
   frame. A screen eighty millimetres across on a gun held at arm's
   length is forty chunky pixels once the lo-fi pass has had it; a feed
   that updates thirty times a second on it is indistinguishable from
   one that updates sixty, and it is a whole scene render either way.
   The rest of the time the panel samples the target it already has.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHY THE GAUGES ARE A CANVAS AND NOT GEOMETRY

   Round. The user asked for round, and an arc swept to an angle is one
   call in a 2D context and a rebuilt vertex ring in three. The canvas
   is PANEL texels square, redrawn only when one of the numbers on it
   has actually moved — the same dirty key the readout uses, for the
   same reason (see js/hud.js) — and uploaded as an RGBA texture the
   screen shader lays over the feed.

   It is drawn in the lens's own green, because the model says the
   optics are green and a monitor that does not match its own glass is
   two parts from two guns.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   AND WHY THE UVs ARE NOT THE FILE'S

   The panel's own UVs live in a twenty-six thousandth of the sheet —
   0.495 to 0.521 across, 0.704 to 0.722 up — because in the original
   it is one flat dark patch of a texture atlas and needs no more.
   Mapping a screen through them would sample one texel.

   So the screen makes its own, out of the mesh's LOCAL POSITION, which
   it can do because the panel is planar: every one of its thirteen
   vertices sits at z = -0.1694, so x and y across the panel's own
   bounding box ARE the two axes of the picture. setPanelBox is handed
   that box at load time, measured off the geometry the file actually
   shipped rather than the numbers written here, so a re-export that
   moves the panel moves the picture with it.

   THE U AXIS IS FLIPPED and that is not a fudge. js/weapon3d.js turns
   every model half a circle about y so its barrel points away from the
   eye, and a half turn about y sends model +x to view -x: the panel's
   right-hand edge is the left-hand edge of what you see. Un-flipped,
   the scope feed is a mirror — which is exactly what it looked like the
   first time, and exactly what a test pattern showed.
   ===================================================================== */

/* The feed, in texels. Square because the panel is: 80.3mm by 77.7mm. */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE ZOOM IS NOT A ZOOM, IT IS PUTTING YOUR EYE TO THE SCOPE

   At the user's request, and it is a better idea than the one it
   replaces. The first version narrowed the world's field of view and
   magnified the feed on the panel by twelve: what you got was a
   telescope that happened to be painted on a gun, and the gun itself
   stayed exactly where it was, down in the corner, while the picture
   around it changed. Two things were being zoomed and neither of them
   was the thing the player was looking at.

   What it does now is MOVE THE WEAPON. The lance comes up and back so
   the screen on its rear deck arrives in front of your eye and fills
   the middle of the frame — see `aim` in GUNS (js/weapon3d.js), which
   is a second hold the gun blends to. The world behind it barely
   narrows. The feed on the panel barely magnifies. The whole of the
   change is that you have raised the thing and put your face to it,
   which is what looking through a scope IS.

   SO THE MAGNIFICATIONS ARE SMALL NOW. Two and a bit, and three and a
   bit: enough that the panel is worth looking at rather than being a
   window onto what you can already see, and nowhere near the twelve
   that made it a separate game. The far end of the town is still
   further off than it was; you just have to walk. */

     thing on this screen and the one the whole weapon is about — is
     drawn at 0.40 of the way out with a rim of its own on top of that.
     The ring was inside the part that had been faded to black, so the

     WHAT THE SCREEN LOOKS LIKE, and it is laid out for the size it is
     ACTUALLY SEEN AT

     The panel is eighty millimetres on a gun held at arm's length: on a
     thousand-pixel window it is about a hundred pixels across, and then
     the lo-fi pass resolves that down to forty chunky ones. Forty. The
     first cut of this screen had two arc gauges with their own labels,
     a third round dial, a range readout and a four-rung ladder on the
     reticle, and at forty pixels all of it was one green smear.

     So it is FOUR THINGS, each of which survives being forty pixels
     across:

       the outer ring    the charge, three quarters of a turn, thick
                         enough to read as a bar, with the three stage
                         marks cut through it
       the inner ring    the window at the top of the charge, draining,
                         concentric inside it and going the same way, so
                         the two are one instrument and not two
       four pips         the cell, because it holds four and four dots
                         are legible at a size an arc is not
       the reticle       a cross with a gap

     and one character, the stage, big under the top of the ring.
     Nothing else. The zoom sits under the reticle in small type because
     it is the one thing the player changes by hand and so is the one
     thing they can be expected to go looking for.

     EVERYTHING IS INSIDE THE BEZEL, which is a SQUARE one — the glass
     goes dark at max(|x|, |y|) * 2 > 0.94 off the middle, so what
     matters is the greater of the two axes and not the distance. The
     dial reaches 0.907 of that at its widest, which is the warning bar
     at the bottom. That was the bug the first cut had: the charge ring,
     the biggest thing on this screen and the one the whole weapon is
     about, was drawn at 0.44 with a rim of its own on top, which is to
     say inside the part that had already been faded out. The gauge was
     not on the gauge. The suite draws this method into a context that
     records where the ink went and measures it, rather than trusting
     the number in this paragraph.

       with it.
