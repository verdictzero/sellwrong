/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — actors: the state machine, and Doom's chase
   =====================================================================

   An actor is a position, a state, and a countdown. Every tic the
   countdown drops by one; when it hits zero the actor moves to the next
   state, which sets a new sprite frame, a new countdown, and calls one
   action function. Everything a monster does happens inside an action
   function called from a state, which is why Doom monsters can be
   interrupted but never caught halfway through a decision.

   THE CHASE is P_NewChaseDir, reproduced closely, because it is the
   single most important forty lines in the game and nothing simpler
   behaves like it. A monster does not path-find. It picks whichever of
   eight compass directions points most nearly at you, tries to walk that
   way, and if it cannot, works through the others in a randomised order
   until something gives. What comes out of that is a thing that
   confidently walks into a shelf, hesitates, slides along it, finds the
   end and comes round — with no graph, no nodes, and no map data at all.

   The refusal to turn round unless there is nothing else left
   (`turnaround` is tried last, always) is what stops monsters
   oscillating in a doorway, and is the detail most reimplementations
   drop.

   NOTHING CHASES YOU YET. The two staff monsters that used to are gone
   and the responders that will are not written, so at the moment every
   line about the chase below runs for nobody. It stays exactly as it is,
   for two reasons: it is correct, and getting it correct a second time
   from the same source would take longer than reading it does. When a
   fire crew walks up the road it will walk on this.

   BURNING is this game's own addition and it is deliberately not a
   status effect on a health bar. Anything alight takes damage on a
   timer and LIGHTS WHAT IT IS STANDING ON, so a shopper who catches at
   the end of an aisle does more damage to the store than the shot that
   lit them.

   THE BLOCKMAP, for the crowd

   Doom kept one of these and this game did not, because for a hundred
   and twenty actors a scan of the list is faster than a hash lookup and
   the honest thing is the simple thing. At eight hundred it is not: a
   crowd deciding where to step asks "is anybody standing there" once per
   candidate direction per actor, which against a flat list is the crowd
   squared, and the crowd squared is what stopped the last increase from
   going further.

   So: a hash of cells 128 units across, holding every actor that was
   ever solid. `near` visits the nine cells around a point, which for a
   query radius under a cell is every actor that could possibly overlap
   and no more.

   ONLY THE POSITION HAS TO BE RIGHT. Whether an actor is still solid,
   still alive and still in the world changes in a dozen places — a
   corpse stops being solid, a splat is taken away when the cap is
   reached — and threading grid maintenance through all of them is how
   you get a crowd that can walk through a body one time in a thousand.
   Instead a thing that has stopped being solid stays in the grid and the
   CALLER filters it, exactly as it filtered the flat list. The waste is
   a handful of entries per cell; the guarantee is that the grid can
   never disagree with the world about who is where.

     FROZEN

     The other end of the same dial, and it is deliberately NOT the
     mirror image of being on fire. Fire is a countdown somebody else
     started: you catch, you run, you go off, and nothing you or the
     player does in between changes the ending. Cold is a STATE you are
     held in and can come out of — which is the only reason it is worth
     having a second stream in the game at all.

     THREE THINGS CAN HAPPEN TO A FROZEN PERSON and the player picks:

       leave them      the frost bleeds off on its own and they thaw,
                       get up and run, which is the outcome that makes
                       freezing them a DECISION rather than a slower way
                       of killing them
       burn them       fire on ice is an EXECUTION and not a thaw. They
                       stay where they are, the drawing is eaten from
                       the feet up and they collapse into a heap of ash
                       — see burnAway. Standing in a hot cell counts:
                       you do not have to hit them, you have to make it
                       warm
       break them      anything that hits a frozen person shatters them,
                       whole, into bloody frozen chunks

     AND ICE IS SOLID, which is the part that makes this a level-design
     tool as well as a weapon. A frozen shopper stops being something you
     walk through and becomes something you walk around — and so does
     everybody else, including the crowd running for the doors.

     AND IT IS A HOLD, which is the part that makes the list above a
     list. Those three are the ONLY ways out, and they are only the only
     ways out because setState refuses everything else for as long as
     the ice is on — see the note there. A fright, a bang, the noise of
     the player's own gun: a system that makes people react does not get
     to make this one react, or "frozen" is a tint and a pause rather
     than a state you put somebody in.

     BURNING AWAY

     What the fire does to somebody who is still in the ice, and the
     only thing in the game that kills a person slowly enough to watch.

     IT IS NOT A THAW. Fire used to melt a frozen shopper free and set
     them running, which made the flamethrower the counter to the
     extinguisher and made freezing somebody a thing the player could
     undo by mistake. The pair are worth more as a COMBINATION: freeze
     one, burn them, and they are gone where they stood — no fireball,
     no thirteen pieces two aisles away, no stampede. It is the quiet
     way of emptying an aisle, and with the shatter that is now two of
     them, which is what the second weapon was for.

     WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IS NOT IN THIS FILE. `ash` winds from 0 to 1 and
     the sprite shader eats the drawing with it, from the feet up,
     behind a line of coals — see the ASH block in js/material.js. All
     that happens here is the number, the smoke, and the heap at the
     end. The ice goes in the first half second, so the blue is off them

     DO NOT DRAW WHAT CANNOT BE SEEN

     Every standee is its own mesh with its own material — it has to be,

     seven hundred is seven hundred draw calls and seven hundred uniform
     updates a frame. And it was ALL of them, every frame, however far

     frustumCulled = false, because a quad the shader turns has bounds
     that are a lie, so three.js was not allowed to cull any of them.

     So it is done here, where the lie does not matter, with the two
     tests that are safe for a billboard:

       BEHIND THE EYE. Every sprite in the game is turned to the camera
       PLANE rather than the camera point, so a thing far enough behind
       that plane is edge-on and invisible by construction.

       TOO FAR TO MATTER. Past the end of the parade, and well past
       where the distance falloff has taken a standee to its darkest
       step.

     The cone is deliberately generous — it keeps everything within
     eighty degrees of the view axis, against a horizontal field of
     about forty-eight — because a sprite is as wide as it is and
     popping one in at the edge of the screen is worse than drawing it.
     Even so it is most of the crowd: the half behind you, plus what is
     out to the sides. Anything closer than three metres is never culled
     at all, whatever the angle, because at that range the quad is wider
     than the screen.

       Nine samples of the fire grid is a person who can see flames.
       Nobody in a supermarket finds out about a fire that way: they find
       out because the aisle in front of them is suddenly full of people
       going the other way. Without that, a shop this size behaves as
       hundreds of independent people who each notice at 320 units, and
       the front end stands at the tills while the back of the store
       burns — which is not what a crowd does and, with a fire six times
       faster than it used to be, meant most of them never started
       moving until it was on them.

       So panic is contagious, and it travels at the speed of somebody
       running past you. It borrows the panic it catches — the point
       being run FROM comes across with it, so a stampede goes one way
       rather than each new person choosing afresh from where they happen
       to be standing.

       It cannot start itself: every chain of this ends at somebody who
       actually saw the fire in the loop above, and if the shop is not
       alight there is nothing to catch.

       AND IT HAS TO RUN DOWN, which is the part that took two goes. A
       fright handed on at full strength is a loop: two people in the
       woods four hundred units behind the store, neither of them able to
       see a fire, each renewing the other for the rest of the level —
       which is exactly what happened, six hundred of them, running on
       the spot in the trees. So what is passed on is what is LEFT minus
       a bit, a rumour weakens with every telling, and a chain of it dies
       after about a dozen hops unless somebody along it can actually see
       the fire and start a fresh one. */

     WHICH WAY OUT

     The map publishes every way out of the building as a point on the
     OUTSIDE of it — six fire exits down the flanks and the two front
     sliders; see level.exits in js/maps/sellwrong.js. This picks one.

     NEAREST IS NOT ENOUGH, and the case that proves it is the one that
     happens most: a fire at the west end of the mid cross-aisle is
     nearest to the west mid exit for everybody standing in it, including
     the people the fire is between. So an exit is charged for being
     close to the thing being run from, and the charge is large enough to
     lose a thousand units of walking — because a longer way out you can
     use beats a shorter one you cannot.

     RE-PICKED ON A TIMER, not every step. The two terms both drift, and
     a shopper who re-decides every step in the region where two exits
     score the same walks on the spot between them. Once a second is
     often enough to notice the aisle ahead has caught, and rare enough
     that the decision holds long enough to act on.

  /* One step of getting out of here.

     NOT Doom's chase with the sign flipped. P_NewChaseDir walks toward a
     thing and its whole cleverness is about not oscillating in a
     doorway; running away is a different problem, because the thing you
     are running from is a REGION and the wrong step is not a step that
     wastes time, it is a step into the fire. So the eight directions are
     SCORED — how much closer to the way out it gets you, minus how hot
     it is where you would land, minus a little for turning — and the
     best walkable one wins.

     AND THERE IS A WAY OUT NOW, which changed what this function is.
     Running AWAY from a fire in a supermarket takes you to the back of
     the shop and then into a corner, because that is what "away" means
     inside a rectangle with one door in it: the crowd used to pile into
     the frozen aisle and cook. So the target is an EXIT and the fire is
     only a penalty on the step — get further from the flames if you can,
     but get to the door either way. The two behaviours are the same
     eight-way scorer with the sign of one term flipped, which is why
     they are one function and not two.

     GREEDY, AND IT WORKS HERE FOR A REASON WORTH WRITING DOWN. Hill
     climbing toward a point gets stuck in dead ends, and a supermarket
     is nothing but dead ends — except that every aisle in this one runs
     north-south and opens onto a cross-aisle at BOTH ends, and every
     exit sits on a cross-aisle. So from anywhere in an aisle the door is
     never at your own y: moving toward the nearer cross-aisle always
     gets you closer to it, and the aisle you are in is a corridor to
     somewhere rather than a pocket. No graph, no nodes, and eight
     hundred of them cost eight distance calls each. */
