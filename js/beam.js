   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the positron beam
   =====================================================================

   WHAT THE USER ASKED FOR: "the beam from Wing Zero's buster rifle,
   everything in linear path destroyed, like a linear columnar nuclear
   explosion". Every decision in this file is downstream of that
   sentence, so it is worth being precise about what it describes.

   IT IS NOT A LASER. A laser is a line you draw to a hit point and it
   stops at the first thing it touches. This is a COLUMN two to eight
   metres across that is drawn from the muzzle to the far side of the
   map and does not stop at anything, because nothing it touches is
   still there afterwards. There is no hit point. The whole segment is
   the hit.

   IT IS NOT AN EVENT. A shot happens in a tic; this lasts three to five
   seconds and does its work every tic of that (see js/player.js,
   BEAM_SECONDS). What that buys is the one thing the weapon is for: the
   player is nailed to the floor while it is out, but the barrel is not,
   so a discharge is something you LEAN across a street. The line moves,
   and everything the line has crossed by the time it stops is gone.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE FOUR THINGS IT DOES, and the order is the order of the tic

     1  the bodies      everything soft inside the column, every tic,
                        for enough that there is no survivable stage
     2  the buildings   integrity off every region the column passes
                        through, on a slower clock — see PASS_EVERY
     3  the fire        heat and accelerant laid down the whole length,
                        store grid and woodland both, so what the beam
                        did not finish burns
     4  the picture     fireballs and dust up the line, which is what
                        makes it read as a column of detonation rather
                        than a strip light

   WHY THE BUILDINGS ARE ON A SLOWER CLOCK THAN THE BODIES. Taking a
   region down is a walk over the fire grid — see FireSystem.damageLine,
   which is where that walk lives, because the grid belongs to the fire
   and not to this. A stage-three column is eight metres across and a
   hundred and sixty metres long, and the box that bounds it is a good
   part of the town: doing it thirty-five times a second for five
   seconds is a hundred and seventy-five sweeps of a grid to answer a
   question whose answer changes about ten times. PASS_EVERY makes it
   about twelve times a second, with the bite multiplied to match, so
   the same amount of building comes down and the arithmetic happens
   a third as often. Bodies are a flat loop over the actor list and
   cost nothing, so they run every tic where the player can see them.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   HOW IT IS DRAWN, and why it is a TUBE

   The obvious way to draw a beam is the way js/tracers.js draws a
   round: a quad spread sideways along the axis that is across both the
   line and the line to the eye, so it faces you however you stand. That
   is right for a tracer and catastrophically wrong for this one,
   because of WHO IS LOOKING. A tracer is something you watch go past. A
   beam is something you are firing, which means the eye is at one end
   of it looking along it — and a view-facing quad seen exactly end-on
   is a line one pixel wide. The most important beam in the game would
   be invisible to the only person who ever sees it.

   So it is real geometry: a tube of SIDES sides and SEGS rings, rebuilt
   every frame around the current axis. Looking down a tube shows you
   the inside of a tube, which is exactly the shot — a ring of light
   receding to a point — and looking across one shows you a column.

   THREE OF THEM, NESTED, because a column of light is not one colour.
   The core is white and lit through its whole face; the body is the
   yellow-white of the first half second of something nuclear; the halo
   is the lance's own lens green and is lit only at its SILHOUETTE,
   which is what makes it read as a volume of glow rather than a painted
   pipe. Fresnel against the view direction is the whole of that
   difference and it is two lines of shader.

   AND RINGS TRAVELLING OUT OF THE MUZZLE, which is the Gundam shot and
   not a flourish: a column with nothing moving along it has no speed
   and no direction, and five seconds of a static glowing pipe reads as
   a prop. The rings say which end it came from.

   All of it additive, none of it writing depth, one draw call.

/* AND HOW WIDE, by stage, and this is the number the whole dial-back
   turns on.

   It was 46, 82 and 130: a person is thirty-two units across, so the
   top stage was a column eight people wide that took the entire front
   of a house at once. You did not aim it, you pointed it, and whatever
   was within four metres of what you meant went with the thing you
   meant. That is a weapon of mass destruction and at the user's request
   this is not one any more.

   A radius of twenty-four is forty-eight across: one and a half people
   rather than eight, and a sixth of the width. It takes the person the
   crosshair was on and at most a shoulder of whoever is pressed against
   them, instead of the house they were standing in front of — which is
   the difference between a siege engine and a rifle, and it is a single
   number.

   AND IT CANNOT GO NARROWER, which is the part worth writing down. This
   radius is also the radius of the hole the shot bores through every
   wall it crosses (see breaches.cut below), and the player is thirty-
   two units across: at forty-eight there are eight units of clearance
   either side and you can walk through your own hole, which is a thing
   this game already promises. At thirty you could not. Twenty-four is
   the floor and the reason is collision, not taste.

   IT IS STILL VISIBLE, which was the other worry. Forty-eight units at
   five hundred away is about fifty pixels on an 853-wide render, and it
   is an additive tube with nested shells and a bloom over the top of
   it. What it stops being is the whole screen. */

   Narrowing the column did not soften it and should not have — a
   positron lance that grazed you and left you standing would be a
   worse weapon and a stranger one. What changed is how much of the
   street is inside it, not what being inside it costs. */
export const BEAM_DAMAGE = [900, 1800, 3200];

/* AND TO A BUILDING: integrity off a region at the centre of the
   column, per pass. A region starts at 1.

   THESE USED TO BRING A HOUSE DOWN IN ONE SHOT — 1.30 a pass at the top
   stage, which is the whole of a region's integrity in a single pass,
   with fifty-odd passes left to go. Every discharge levelled whatever
   it was aimed through, and the hole the beam punched in the front of
   the building was academic because the building followed it down a
   quarter of a second later.

   Now no single shot can take anything down, at any stage, however
   squarely it is aimed: the absolute worst a stage-three discharge can
   do to one region is 0.50, and the measured figure against the town is
   0.34. THREE shots do it. You hold four cells, so levelling a building
   costs three quarters of everything you have and twenty-one seconds of
   charging — a decision rather than a side effect of shooting at a man
   standing in front of it. That is the dial-back in one line: you can
   still do it, and you can no longer do it by accident.

   TWO THINGS TO MIND IN THE ARITHMETIC, both of which bit while these
   numbers were being set:

     PASS_EVERY. These are per pass and the CALLER multiplies by it, so
     a stage-three discharge is 49 tics = 16 passes x 3 x 0.0105 = 0.50,
     not 16 x 0.0105. Forgetting that factor is how the first cut of
     this table came out at 1.34 and levelled a house in one shot
     anyway — the exact thing it was written to stop.

     AND 0.50 IS THE CEILING, NOT THE FIGURE. damageLine bites
     `amount * (1 - |t| / radius)` and keeps the largest bite any sample
     of a region took (see FireSystem.damageLine), so only a region the
     column's dead centre passes through gets the whole of it. Measured
     against the town the worst-hit region loses 0.34 a shot, which is
     where the three comes from. The suite checks the CEILING, because
     that is the part that can be proved from the constants and is also
     the part that matters: under 1.0 means never in one shot. */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE COLUMN IS NAILED TO THE LINE IT WAS FIRED ALONG

   There is a real problem here and it is worth stating before the fix,
   because the fix used to be the opposite of this.

   A beam fired from the gun in your hands, along the line you are
   looking down, is seen END-ON. Always. However you turn, the column
   turns with you and what is on screen is its cross-section: a bright
   disc in the middle of the frame. That is geometrically unavoidable
   and it is what the first three screenshots of this were — a glowing
   blob over a lawn, with none of the length that is the entire point of
   the thing.

   THE FIRST ANSWER WAS INERTIA. The barrel said where the column wanted
   to be and the column chased it, at a time constant, so while you
   swept it trailed twenty degrees behind and you saw its side. It
   worked, and it cost the one thing this weapon is now for: the damage
   followed the DRAWN column rather than the crosshair, so where the
   shot landed depended on how you happened to be moving your wrist as
   you let go. You could not aim it. You could only point it and lean.

   THE SECOND ANSWER IS BETTER AT BOTH JOBS. The line — origin AND
   direction — is taken once, at the instant the trigger comes up, and
   never moves again. So:

     it goes exactly where the crosshair was, which is the whole of
     what the user asked for in asking for a sniper;

     and the end-on problem solves itself more completely than the lag
     ever solved it, because the moment you turn your head AT ALL the
     column is no longer in front of you. It is a fixed line in the
     world and you are looking across it. Turn ninety degrees and you
     see the entire eight thousand units of it in profile.

   The feet are nailed down for the second and a half either way (see
   Player.move), so the origin cannot drift more than the width of your
   own shoulders; and the head is free now precisely BECAUSE the line
   does not follow it — see the note where BEAM_TURN used to be in
   js/player.js.

   It is also more true than the lag was. Eight thousand units of plasma
   does not pivot because you moved your wrist — and it does not trail
   round after it either. It goes where it was pointed when it left. */

/* THE SHAKE, in radians of view and units of eye, at the peak.

   IT IS A KICK NOW AND NOT A RUMBLE. It was 1.0 settling to a hum of
   0.34 over half a second, and that was right for a five-second column
   you steered: the picture had to keep saying "this is enormous and it
   is still happening" for the whole of it. This one is over in a second
   and a half and you are not steering it, so what the picture has to
   say is that a very large thing just LEFT — hard on the first few
   frames and then almost nothing, so you can watch where the shot went

   AND THE NEAR END IS CAPPED, BECAUSE A TUBE IS HOLLOW

   The shells are tubes, which is right from the side and is a hole from
   the front — and the front is where the player always is. Looking down
   the bore of a hollow additive pipe you see past the near opening, all
   the way down the inside to the taper at the far end, and THROUGH it
   to the world beyond: the middle of the column comes out as a dim disc
   of whatever is behind it. That is what the third screenshot of this
   was, a green dome with a white ring round it, and it is the same
   class of mistake as the Fresnel one above — geometry that reads
   correctly from an angle nobody will ever look at it from.

   So the two inner shells — the two lit flat, which is not a
   coincidence: a cap is a flat disc and a Fresnel would band it — are
   closed at the near end with a triangle fan. One extra vertex each.
   Seen down the bore it is a filled white disc; seen from the side it
   is edge-on and contributes nothing, which is exactly the right
   behaviour in both cases.

   THE FOUR SHELLS, innermost first, AND WHAT LIGHTS EACH ONE

   `rim` is the whole of the difference and it is not a style knob, it is
   the answer to a bug. Fresnel — brighter where the surface turns away
   from you — is what makes a hollow tube read as a VOLUME of glow rather
   than as a painted pipe, and it is right for the outer shells. It is
   exactly wrong for the innermost one, because of where the eye is.

   The player fires this thing along their own line of sight, so they are
   looking straight DOWN the bore. Every surface of the tube is then seen
   edge-on: the radial normal is perpendicular to the view, Fresnel is at
   its maximum everywhere at once, and a shell lit by it is brightest in
   a RING and darkest in the middle. Three of those nested is a
   bullseye — which is precisely what the first screenshot of this was,
   a dark green target floating over a lawn, and not a beam at all.

   So the core is lit FLAT: one is one, whichever way you are looking at
   it, and it fills its own disc with white. Seen from the side it is a
   white rod; seen down the bore it is a white sun. Both are what a beam
   core is. The shells outside it keep their Fresnel and are what give it
   an edge.

   THE NECK, AND WHY IT IS IN WORLD UNITS AND NOT IN A FRACTION

   The first cut of this flared the column over the first five per cent
   of its length, which on an eight-thousand-unit beam is four hundred
   units and sounded reasonable. It is not, because of where the EYE is.
   The column is born at the muzzle, which is about forty-six units in
   front of the player (see NOZZLE_REACH in js/weapon3d.js), and at the
   third stage it is a hundred and thirty units in radius. Forty-six is
   less than a hundred and thirty: the player is standing INSIDE the
   first section of their own beam, looking at the inside of a
   double-sided additive tube from a few centimetres away, which is a
   white screen and nothing else. That is exactly what the first
   screenshot of it was.

   So the column opens out over NECK world units — a real distance, from
   the metal — and is not DRAWN at all over the first HIDE of them. What
   covers the join is the muzzle bloom, which is particles and is meant
   to be there anyway: a beam leaves a gun in a ball of light, and the
   ball is where the tube would have been in your face.

   AND BOTH CAME DOWN WITH THE COLUMN. They were 430 and 190, tuned
   against a stage-three radius of 130 where the player really was
   standing inside their own beam — the muzzle is about forty-six units
   out and the tube was a hundred and thirty across, so there was no
   choice. At a radius of twenty-four the eye is comfortably OUTSIDE the
   tube and hiding the first hundred and ninety units of it would only
   be drawing a shot that starts two car lengths in front of the gun,
   which for a weapon you are supposed to be aiming looks like a fault.
   Fifty-five is just past the metal, where the muzzle bloom is.

   THEY STILL SCALE WITH THE RADIUS, as ratios of the top stage's, so
   anything wider than the lance pushes them back out and cannot put the
   eye inside its own column again. At the top stage the two agree
   exactly and the ratio changes nothing; it is a floor under a wider
   beam and not a number anything currently uses. */
