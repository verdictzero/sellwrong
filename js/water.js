/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the water
   =====================================================================

   What comes out of the fire truck's cannon (see FireTruck in
   js/vehicles.js), and the third stream in the game after the flame and
   the cold. Same shape of thing as js/frost.js — particles leaving a
   nozzle, slowing in the air, landing on something — with the physics
   of a LIQUID JET, which is the one this game had not got:

     IT IS THROWN AND IT FALLS. Water leaves a monitor nozzle fast and
     holds its speed far better than a gas does, so the drag is gentle
     and the reach is long, and then it comes down in an arc — which is
     why the truck lobs it (see aimPitch) rather than pointing it.

     IT IS HEAVY, so what it lands on it puts out HARD: more heat out of
     the grid than a burst of CO2, over a wider patch, trees along with
     it. It cannot put back what has burned, any more than the
     extinguisher can — see FireSystem.douse.

     IT PUTS PEOPLE OUT, and it moves them: a person alight is soaked
     out (Actor.soak), and anybody the jet goes through is shoved along
     it, which includes you. It does not freeze anybody; that is the
     extinguisher's trick.

     AND A BURNING VEHICLE: the jet landing by one takes the fire off it
     (Vehicle.douse... the burn counter, not the flames' picture alone),
     so the car the flamethrower lit in the lot does not go up if the
     brigade gets to it first. One that has started CHARRING is past
     saving, which is the same rule as a burnt aisle.

   Every number is per tic, like everything else in the game.
