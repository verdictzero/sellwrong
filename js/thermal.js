/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — the thermal sight on the side of the box
   =====================================================================

   THE SAME METHOD AS THE LANCE'S SCREEN, at the user's request: "use
   same method as sniper rifle display to put a thermal scope live view
   on a plane in the scope". So this is js/scope.js — it IS a Scope, by
   inheritance, and everything that file says about why the feed is a
   second render of the one scene through a narrower camera, why it is
   small and every other frame, and why the gauges are a canvas, is true
   here without being said twice. What is different is three things.

   THE PLANE. The lance's file has a mesh named for a display; the
   launcher's has a flat face on the back of its sight and nothing on
   it. So the plane is the game's — `screen` in GUNS (js/weapon3d.js)
   builds a quad on that face, in the model's own units, and hangs this
   scope's screen material on it — and from then on it is measured and
   mapped exactly as the lance's panel is, u flip and all.

   THE PICTURE IS HEAT, NOT LIGHT. For the one render call this makes a
   frame, the shared uniform world.thermal is on (js/material.js), and
   every wall, floor, tree, car, puff and person in the scene answers
   how WARM it is instead of what colour it is: the night in a narrow
   cold band, people warm whatever they are wearing, engines warm when
   they are running, fire and lamps white, the sky black, a frozen
   shopper colder than the pavement, smoke all but invisible. What is
   warm is decided by js/missiles.js's heatSources — the same question
   the seeker asks — so the screen can only ever glow on what the
   launcher can lock, and never on what it cannot.

   The screen then does to that one number what a thermal camera does:
   runs it up IRONBOW — black through indigo, magenta, red, orange,
   yellow to white — in bands, because everything in this game is
   banded, and with the scan lines and the curved glass the lance's
   screen has, so the two read as instruments from the same armoury.

   THE GLASS SAYS WHAT THE SEEKER IS DOING. Four things, for the reason
   the lance's screen has four — this panel is a few centimetres across
   and the lo-fi pass takes it down to a few dozen chunky pixels:

     the seeker circle   how far off the middle a heat source may be to
                         be acquired, drawn at its true size for this
                         magnification, so zooming in makes the circle
                         bigger and the seeker easier to put on a thing
     the brackets        amber, one on every locked target, a pip in
                         each corner for every lock on it past the
                         first; and a white one closing in, blinking,
                         on whatever is being acquired
     four tube pips      along the bottom: loaded, empty, or loaded and
                         spoken for by a lock
     one character       the number of locks, big, at the top

   and the zoom, small, because it is the one thing the player sets by
   hand and so the one thing they will go looking for.
