/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — THE BOXES, AND HOW THEY BURN
   =====================================================================

   The things standing on the grid (js/maps/grid.js): cubes two cells to
   seven cells a side, green, solid, and the only fuel in the world. All
   of them are ONE MESH and ONE DRAW CALL, and each one burns on its own
   clock.

   WHY THIS EXISTS, which is the whole of the design. The fire in this
   game was a simulation: a grid of fuel and heat over the entire world,
   32 units a cell, stepped every other tic, spreading between
   neighbours, cooking the structure over it and swapping the world's
   textures for charred ones when a region was done (js/fire.js, and THE
   THIRD STAGE in js/textures.js). It is honest and it is expensive, and
   at the user's request it is not what this world uses. What you
   actually WATCH when a thing burns is a front crossing it, coals
   behind the front, and a husk after — and that is a shader over one
   number, not a grid over the world.

   So a box carries ONE number, `front`, which is how far the decay has
   swept down it, and everything you see follows from that number and
   the height of the fragment in the box's OWN space:

     above the front   burnt: the paint gone, soot, and coals that cool
                       the further above the front they are, because
                       further above means it burnt longer ago
     at the front      the fire itself, a narrow band off EMBER_RAMP,
                       torn by a hash of the face's own uv so it is a
                       burn line and not a ruler
     below the front   untouched, and lit like everything else

   TOP TO BOTTOM, at the user's request, and it is the one thing here
   that is a choice rather than a consequence: the front starts at the
   cap and descends. Turning it over is the sign of `front` in the
   fragment shader and nothing else.

   WHAT IT COSTS. One vertex attribute the CPU writes, `burn`, thirty
   floats a box, and only for the boxes that are actually alight. No
   grid, no cells, no texture swap, no geometry rebuild. A hundred and
   fifty boxes is 4,500 vertices in one buffer.

   HOW THE FIRE MOVES BETWEEN THEM, since there is no grid to carry it:
   a box that is properly alight lights its neighbours. SPREAD_R is off
   the FOOTPRINT rather than the centre, so a seven-cell box reaches as
   far past its own wall as a two-cell one does, and a box that has
   nearly finished stops recruiting — a husk does not light anything.

   AND WHAT PUTS IT OUT is water (js/water.js) and CO2 (js/frost.js),
   through douse(). Neither unburns anything: `front` only ever goes up,
   the same promise FireSystem.douse makes about a charred aisle. What
   they save is the bottom of the box the fire has not reached yet.
