/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — bringing real artwork in
   =====================================================================

     node tools/bake-art.mjs

   Everything else in this game is drawn by code at start-up. Two things
   could not be, to begin with: the LOGO, because a procedural
   approximation of somebody's logo is not their logo, and the WEAPON,
   because it is a photograph of a thing and there is no set of
   primitives that gets you there. The argument generalised — the
   headstones, the cemetery iron and the STREET LAMP came in the same
   way, and each is a section of this file.

   So they come in as pictures and leave as SOURCE. This reads the PNGs
   in art/, finds the artwork inside each one, resamples it, snaps every
   pixel to the game's own 256-colour palette, run-length encodes it and
   writes js/art-data.js. Nothing is fetched at run time and there is
   still no build step — the build step is this file, run by hand, when
   the art changes.

   TWO WAYS OF FINDING THE ARTWORK, because the two files were made
   differently. The logo sits on a black field, so it is found by
   brightness and saturation. The weapon sits on chroma-key magenta, so
   it is found by "not that colour" — which is also how it gets its alpha
   channel, because a weapon has to be cut out, not letterboxed.

   WHY FOUR TILES FOR THE LOGO. Sixty-four pixels is the rule for every
   texture in the game and the logo does not get an exemption; it gets
   geometry instead. The four tiles are hung as a two-by-two on the
   entrance tower, which is two ceiling steps and one vertical split —
   see the sign box in js/maps/sellwrong.js. A sector engine cannot draw
   a big picture, but it can draw four small ones next to each other,
   which is the same thing and is how every large sign in Doom was done.

   THE WEAPON IS ONE TILE and it is 64x64 like everything else, with the
   gun laid across the bottom at its own aspect and the top of the frame
   left empty. That empty space is not waste: it is where the muzzle
   flame is drawn, procedurally, over the top of the photograph — which
   is how Doom did its weapons too, one still sprite and a separate
   flash.

   THE ENCODING is run-length pairs of (palette index, count) in base64.
   A logo is mostly flat colour, so a 4096-pixel tile comes out around a
   kilobyte, and the decoder is nine lines that run unchanged in Node and
   in the browser.

/* THE STOCK BOX, BY NAME AND NOT BY DEFAULT. What this tool writes is a
   list of palette INDICES, and an index is only meaningful because every
   box of ramps has the same fifteen in the same order — see the note on
   EARTH_RAMPS in js/palette.js. Which box to QUANTISE against is a
   separate question with one right answer: the fuller one, because a
   photograph snapped into a muted box and then recoloured is a
   photograph that has been through two quantisations. So this asks for
   `stock` outright. It also keeps js/art-data.js stable when the game's
   default tone moves, which is what the CI step that re-bakes and diffs

/* ---------- where the artwork is ----------
   The bounding box of everything that is not the background. Background
   is judged as "dark AND unsaturated", which keeps the black outline and
   the black trolley — both of which are the logo — and drops the field
   they are sitting on.

   SATURATION IS MEANINGLESS IN THE DARK, and that is worth stating
   because it cost an iteration: (0, 2, 1) — a single unit of compression
   noise on a black field — has a max of 2 and a min of 0, so
   (max-min)/max is 1.0 and it reads as the most saturated pixel in the
   image. Every corner of a black background therefore counted as
   artwork, and the crop came out as the whole picture. Saturation only
   means anything above a brightness floor. */

/* ---------- the lettering, out ----------

   Every headstone in art/stones/ was photographed with a word cut into
   it. The prediction was that the word would take care of itself: a
   stone is drawn twenty-eight texels across, a five-letter word is four
   texels tall at that size, and what comes out is the horizontal smudge
   that weathered lettering actually is. Held against the baked tiles,
   that was optimistic — up close it still read as letters, and this
   game has one rule about writing on things and it is that there is
   none of it, ever. The shopfronts keep it, the gravestones kept it
   when they were drawn, and a photograph does not get an exemption.

   SO THE BAND COMES OUT BEFORE THE TILE GOES IN, at full resolution,
   where there is enough of it to replace convincingly. The band is
   found rather than typed: carved letters are darker than the face they
   are cut into, so the row whose mean is furthest BELOW the local
   baseline is the middle of the lettering, and it is grown out while
   the rows either side are still dark. What goes back is a vertical
   interpolation between the clean rows above and below — which is what
   a plain piece of stone between two plain pieces of stone looks like —
   with the grain of a clean row mirrored back over it, because a
   granite face with no speckle in it reads as airbrushed.

/* ===== the cut-outs: a tile each, transparent where the key was =====

   The third kind of artwork this game cannot draw. The logo is a logo
   and the weapon is a photograph of a thing; these are photographs of
   THINGS IN A CEMETERY — eight headstones and a section of the iron
   fence round it — and the argument is the one at the top of this file:
   there is no set of primitives that gets you to weathered granite with
   lichen in the lettering.

   EACH IS ONE TILE AT ITS OWN SIZE, which is the difference from the
   weapon. A headstone is drawn twenty-four wide and a fence panel is
   worn sixty-four by ninety-six; making both of them 64x64 would spend
   three quarters of a stone's tile on nothing and squash the fence. So
   the width and the height travel with the tile and whatever decodes it
   reads them back.

   THE LETTERING GOES BY ITSELF. Every one of these stones was
   photographed with TEST cut into it, and at the size a headstone is
   drawn — twenty-four texels across, which is what the sprite bank
   wants — a five-letter word is four texels tall and comes out as the
   horizontal smudge that weathered lettering actually is. Nothing had
   to be painted out. It is the same rule the shopfronts keep: no name
   on anything, ever. */

/* ===== THE STREET LAMP: one photograph, two tiles, and a watermark =====

   A cobra-head street light on its tapered pole, photographed against a
   chroma key, and the fourth kind of thing this game cannot draw: it is
   a picture of a THING, like the weapon, and a bracket arm with a
   luminaire on the end of it is not a set of primitives.

   IT IS NOT A SPRITE. A sprite turns to face you, and a lamp post that
   turns to face you is a lamp post whose arm swings round to point at
   you wherever you stand. The lamp is GEOMETRY: two masked quads that
   js/mapgeo.js stands in the plane ACROSS the street (see THE STREET
   LAMP IS GEOMETRY there), so the arm reaches out over the carriageway
   from whichever side you look at it, and edge-on it is a line, which is
   what a lamp post is edge-on.

   TWO TILES, CUT WHERE THE THING IS, which is the 64-pixel rule holding
   for a thing 256 units tall. Two parts of the photograph want texels:
   the HEAD — the arm and the luminaire, across the whole width and the
   top seventh of the height — which is wide and short, and the POST —
   the pole and its base plate, a quarter of the width and all the rest
   of the height — which is narrow and tall. One tile for the lot, 64
   tall, gives the pole a single texel; a grid of eight, the way the
   logo is four, spends six of them on the air either side of the pole
   and costs a draw call each. So the head is a 64-wide tile at its own
   aspect, the post is a strip of 24 by 64, and SIZES in js/textures.js
   declares each at the lamp's own size. Where the head stops and the
   post begins is MEASURED off the photograph, not typed: the first row
   under the arm where nothing but the pole is solid, held for twelve
   rows so the arm's own underside cannot fake it.

   THE WATERMARK. The file carries a sparkle in its bottom right corner,
   twenty pixels across, in a pale magenta. The key test catches it on
   this file; keepLargest above is what makes that a rule rather than a
   coincidence, and it is run on every cut-out in this file for the same
   reason. The tool prints what it dropped.

   THE FOOT AND THE LENS come out of the same pass. The foot is where
   the pole stands, as a fraction of the width — it is not the middle of
   the picture, because the arm is all on one side — and the map stands
   the quads so that fraction lands on the thing's own x,y. The lens is
   the underside of the luminaire, which is where js/lamplight.js hangs
   the light. Both are fractions of the artwork so that nothing
   downstream knows how big the photograph was. */
