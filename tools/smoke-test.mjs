   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — smoke test
   =====================================================================

   node tools/smoke-test.mjs

   No install, no browser. Everything that is not WebGL is checked here:
   the palette, the texture and sprite bakeries, the map, the collision,
   the state tables and the fire grid.

   The checks earn their place by having caught something. Each one below
   corresponds to a bug that reached a screenshot before it was found:

     - a sprite whose art wrapped around the edge of its own canvas, so
       a forearm drawn off the bottom appeared in the sky
     - a monster state naming a frame letter the bakery never made, so
       the Stocker's pain frame did not exist
     - a wall texture chosen by which sector was DECLARED first, so an
       aisle had shelving down one side and blank plaster down the other
     - a move long enough to step clean through a wall without any test
       noticing it had been there

   A test suite for a game is mostly worthless — you cannot assert that
   something is fun. But every one of those was a data error with a
   correct answer, and every one of them is cheaper to catch here.
   ===================================================================== */

   hand — which is the kind of copy that drifts and then passes while the

   A GLSL block lives in a JavaScript template literal, and a template

   is — so a pair of them in a COMMENT closes the shader mid-sentence
   and the rest of it silently becomes JavaScript. The file still parses
   as far as node is concerned; the game dies on IMPORT with "Unexpected
   identifier", naming a word out of a comment, and says nothing about
   which file or why.

   It has cost two debugging sessions, and it has to be checked HERE,
   at the top, reading the file as TEXT — a check further down cannot
   run, because the import that kills the process happens first. What is
   asserted is not "is there a stray backtick" but "does each shader
   still reach the line it is supposed to end on", which is the thing

  /* ---------- the fire, which the game draws itself -------------------

     Three things are worth holding to a number here, because all three
     were wrong before and none of them announces itself:

       THE BOTTOM IS ROUND. Measured the only way that means anything —
       the lowest lit row of every COLUMN. A flame with a flat foot has
       every column ending on the same row, whatever its silhouette does
       from the sides, and that is exactly what the painted strips did
       and what masking them could not fix. So: how far the bottom edge
       rises from the deepest column to the shallowest, against how wide
       the flame is. The old strips scored 0.04 of their width. Anything
       at or under about a tenth is a flat bottom with the corners taken
       off.

       IT LOOPS. The last frame hands back to the first for the whole
       time something is alight, which is most of the game. If the wrap
       moves more than an ordinary step does, that is a pop, and it is
       the one animation fault a player will notice every second.

       NOTHING IS CLIPPED BY ITS OWN CELL. A lick that runs off the side
       of the frame is a vertical straight edge on a fire — the same
       fault as the flat bottom, turned ninety degrees — and one that
       runs off the bottom loses the round foot that is the point. The
       top is allowed: that is where the licks go. */

   THE PLAYER DOES NOT START IN A FIELD ANY MORE

   For most of this game's life the spawn was the mouth of the car park,
   and half a dozen fixtures below quietly took advantage of it: a jet of
   flame needs somewhere to land, a round needs a wall four thousand
   units away to put a hole in, a target has to be brought out "in front
   of the player" with nothing between the two of them, and the
   responders' six seconds is measured to wherever you happen to be.
   None of them said so. They just used `g.player` where it stood.

   The player is a cashier now — in the well of the middle checkstand,
   thirty units from a counter, inside a crowd — and every one of those
   fixtures broke at once, all of them for the same reason and none of
   them because anything they are about had changed.

   So the assumption is written down instead. `level.viewpoint` is the
   old spawn, kept on the level as the place it always was, and a
   fixture that wants open ground asks for it. What is left over is
   worth having: the five checks below now say out loud that they are
   about the car park, and if the shop ever changes under them again
   they will keep meaning the same thing.

     surfaces set it.

     the whole tic count, which advances thirty-five times a second while

    /* --- AND THE PILOT LIGHT IS ON THE NOZZLE -----------------------
       Reported by the user as misaligned, and it was: 0.537m off on a
       gun 1.4m long, a fifth of the screen's height below the barrel
       and nearly off the bottom of the frame.

       THE TWO EFFECTS ON THE GUN HANG OFF DIFFERENT THINGS, and that
       asymmetry is the whole of it. The muzzle is a child of the MODEL,
       so it takes the anchor in the model's own units and is right by
       construction. The pilot flame cannot be — the model is turned a
       half circle to point its barrel at the camera, and a flame quad
       inheriting that turn is a flame seen from behind — so it hangs
       off the GROUP instead, and a point handed to `position` is read
       in the PARENT's space. It was being given a WORLD-space point, so
       the group's own transform — the whole of VIEW.pos, the yaw, the
       bob — was applied to it a second time.

       The tell, for anyone who meets this again: the glow the pilot
       throws ON the gun was in the right place the whole time. That
       uniform takes the same vector in view space and is correct; only
       the mesh needed converting back out of the world.

       There is no scene graph in this test — the three stub is a
       handful of empty classes — so what is pinned is the pair of
       conversions in the source, which is where the fault was. */

   A HOLE BLOWN THROUGH A WALL
   =====================================================================

   At the user's request: "any structure in the path of the beam has a
   hole blown through it, the hole will then decay into debris and
   burning". It is geometry and not a decal, because the first thing a
   player does after firing a column of plasma through the front of a
   house is walk into the house through the front of it.

   WHAT IS CHECKED: the arithmetic, which is exact and provable — a wall
   minus its holes has exactly the area it should, and the split is the
   fewest quads that can say so; the merging, because a beam punches a
   dozen times a second and a wall must not collect sixty rectangles;
   and the three things a hole has to be true for besides the renderer,
   which are walking, shooting and seeing.

/* ---------- DIALLED BACK: A SNIPER AND NOT AN ARMAGEDDON ----------------

   At the user's request the lance is a PRECISE weapon now. Three things
   went, and the going of them is most of what is checked here, because
   a feature that is removed leaves no code to break and so leaves
   nothing to notice when it quietly comes back:

     THE OVERCHARGE, in its entirety. Forty seconds past the top of the
     charge and the coil let go where you were standing and killed you,
     with a ladder of CAPACITOR warnings, a screen that glitched harder
     as it climbed, a blast the size of a city block and a third-person
     death camera to watch it from. None of it is here. Holding at the
     top is a five-second window and then a vent.

     THE HEAT, in its entirety. The coil cooked as it wound, the chassis
     glowed with it from the middle out, and over a threshold the gun
     refused its own trigger until it had cooled. Gone. What limits the
     weapon is the magazine, which is four cells at twenty-five seconds
     each.

     AND THE ARMAGEDDON, which was in the numbers rather than in any one
     feature: a column a hundred and thirty units wide that stayed out
     for five seconds, took a building down in one pass, set fire to the
     street and woke the whole town. Every one of those came down, and
     what makes the weapon a sniper rather than a smaller siege engine
     is two of them in particular — a column narrower than one person,
     and a line that is fixed at the trigger instead of chasing the
     barrel, so the shot goes exactly where the crosshair was.

   THE NUMBERS ARE CHECKED AS RELATIONSHIPS, not as literals, wherever
   the relationship is the point: narrower than a person, no collapse in
   one shot, the whole thing over faster than the old shake took to
   settle. A literal would pass a re-tune that broke the intent.

/* ---------- THE READOUT, AND WHICH SIDE OF THE FILTER IT IS ON ----------

   For most of this project's life the bars, the weapon's name and the
   end-of-night card were drawn into the same low-resolution buffer as
   the walls, at the same chunky pixel size, and quantised to the same
   256 colours. At the user's request they are not any more: they are
   their own 2D canvas over the frame, at the device's own resolution,
   and the pipeline never sees them.

   WHAT IS CHECKED IS THE SPLIT ITSELF, because it is the kind of thing
   that gets quietly undone — one overlay added back to the list in
   main.js and the readout is a chunky readout again with nothing
   throwing. So: what is left in the buffer is exactly the two things
   that belong to the PICTURE (the wash, and the fallback gun); the
   readout is measured in the window's own pixels and not in chunky
   ones; the canvas is backed at the device's ratio; and it costs
   nothing on a frame where nothing has moved. */

   Static, not dynamic: js/main.js builds a renderer at the top level and

   both read out of the source. That is a regex over a codebase whose
   style is consistent, which is worth saying out loud — it earns its

     bursting no longer lay new ones (see Giblets._land). One match in
     here reaches 5% of the store and two hundred people never find out
     about it, which is the point of the change and useless as a test of
     the exits.

     SO THE PLAYER DOES IT, which is what the player is now for: the
     flamethrower walked down all eleven aisles, shelf faces both sides,
     about the pace somebody actually moves. Everything after that is

/* ONE VEHICLE, AND IT IS A FILE — nothing but the file. Two whole
   systems have been deleted from under this section. First the drawn
   fleet: seven bodies measured off four-view sheets, built as the visual
   hull of three silhouettes and painted by projecting those views back
   onto them, with about thirty checks holding the atlas, the windows,
   the wheels, the winding and the projected UVs against each other.
   Then tools/prep-van.mjs, which rewrote a model on the way in — halved
   its texture, snapped it to the game's palette, painted a black block
   into a corner of the sheet for the untextured triangles to point at,
   and wrote the axes it had measured into asset.extras.

   assets/models/van.glb is now the author's own export, byte for byte,
   and js/car.js reads it as it stands. So what is checked here is the
   CONVERSION and nothing else — the nodes walked, the axes swapped, the
   scale set, the ground line found, and the model's own UVs taken as
   they are. A missed node matrix still puts a car park full of vans on
   their sides.

   AND THE v, which is the one this section watched go past. It used to
   read "an unflipped v still puts a car park full of vans on their
   sides", which is true and was not what was happening: the v WAS being
   flipped, against a `flipY` on the texture that never happened, because
   `flipY` is ignored for an ImageBitmap. Two flips cancel and one does
   not, so every panel was wearing the wrong half of the sheet — flanks
   painted with the front view — and the van it was written for survived
   that because only 134 of its 624 triangles were textured at all, onto
   a sheet of white bodywork. The model that replaced it is unwrapped all
   over and showed it in the first screenshot. Both halves of the
   convention are pinned below, because either one alone is a trap. */

       winding of its corners and the NORMAL on them — and both of its
       declarations disagree with the SOLID: the shell comes to about
       minus a quarter of its own bounding box, which is a surface wound
       INWARD. The van this replaced was two shells wound against each
       other, and an attempt to fix that by reversing everything when the
       total came out negative turned the body the right way and the
       chassis the wrong way: the car park went from vans seen from the
       inside to vans with no bodywork, a black sill and four wheels.

       The model is not wrong. It renders correctly in Blender and on
       Sketchfab because both of them draw BOTH SIDES — its own material
       says `doubleSided` — and that was the whole of the oversight: this
       renderer culls back faces and the model was authored where that
       never mattered. So: the winding is left exactly as the file has
       it, and the material draws both sides, which is the answer whether
       a file brings one shell or five. The normals are turned outward
       for the FACE LIGHT and nothing else, so a wrong guess costs one
       step of shading and can no longer cull anything or choose

    /* --- AND THE WHITE PAINT COMES OFF IT ---------------------------
       A car park of one model in every bay was a joke worth one look.
       It is twelve colours now, and it is still one model, one sheet
       and one draw call: the paint rides in the vertices and the WHITE
       in the texture is isolated in the shader, by luminance with a
       saturation guard, and multiplied (see the INK block in
       js/material.js).

       WHAT IS CHECKED HERE is the claim the two numbers make: that
       everything which must NOT take the colour — the grille, the
       tyres, the glass, the bumpers, the sheet's own grey background —
       sits entirely below the ramp, and that every bright neutral texel
       sits entirely above it.

       THE BAND BETWEEN THEM IS NOT EMPTY and is not meant to be: it is
       the paint's own shading, the falloff from a lit panel to a
       shadowed one, and it takes a PART of the colour, which is exactly
       what makes a tinted van look painted rather than filled in. An
       earlier version of this check asserted a gap with nothing in it
       and failed on 7.7% of the sheet, all of it the side of the van.

       AND IT IS DONE IN LINEAR, which is the trap this fell into first.
       The sheet is an sRGB texture and is decoded on the way out of
       texture2D, so the numbers in the shader are not the numbers a
       colour picker says about the PNG. Set off the file, the ramp
       caught only the brightest highlights and what came out was a
       white van with a red pinstripe down every edge.

       The thresholds are READ OUT OF THE SHADER rather than repeated
       here, so this cannot quietly drift away from what runs. */

         piece's paint falls inside the paint of the model triangles the
         cut actually caught. Outside that is a piece wearing somebody
         else's panel.

         AND IT IS NOT THAT THE PATCH IS SMALL, which is what this asked
         for until the van was replaced by one unwrapped all over. The
         sheet is a four-view projection: a piece an eighth of a van
         across straddles half of it the moment it has a roof face and a
         flank in it, because those two views are drawn in different
         corners. That is the model being read correctly, not a piece
         going wrong. What a piece must not do is wear MORE of the sheet

       AND NO TWO OF THEM SHARE A FACE YOU CAN SEE

       At the user's request, who saw it shimmering at the checkout.

       Z-FIGHTING IS TWO COPLANAR QUADS FACING THE SAME WAY. Every face
       of a free box winds outward, so two boxes that merely INTERSECT
       are fine — a chimney through a coping has no two faces in the
       same plane — and two that merely TOUCH are fine as well, because
       the plane they share carries one quad facing each way and the one
       you could see is always the far side of solid geometry.

       What is not fine is two boxes sharing a face plane AND a volume.
       Then both have a front-facing quad there, at the same depth, and
       the depth buffer has no answer: what you get is a seam that
       crawls as you move. Four places in this game had it and every one
       was the same mistake — a piece of trim run the full length and
       another run the full width, meeting at a corner where they both
       wanted to be:

         the belt guards against the end plate and the roller cover
         the shopfront mullions against the cill they stand on
         a door frame's jambs against the head that sits on them
         and two wall packs both wanting the mullion between the doors

       IT IS ONLY A BUG WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT, and that is not pedantry:
       the town's cornices and window trims all start two units inside
       the wall and therefore all share that plane with each other, two
       hundred and thirty-nine pairs of them, every one back-facing and
       culled. So the face is stepped off along its own outward normal
       and the question is whether a player can stand there — the same
       flood, and the same standing floor, as the head-height rule
       above. */

       THE OFFICE BLOCK ON A5, AND THE CROSS THAT USED TO BE THERE

       WHAT WAS THERE. Block A5 was the services block and what was on
       it was three rectangles of asphalt — a station lot, a fire
       station apron and a police lot — with no building on any of them
       and the map's usual sixteen units of VOID between each pair,
       because in this map the wall between two rooms is the rectangle
       nobody laid.

       INSIDE A BUILDING THAT IS A WALL AND IS WHAT IT IS FOR. Out in
       the open it is a free-standing slab: a line with a sector on one
       side and nothing on the other is ONE-SIDED, and a one-sided line
       draws its wallTex over the whole height of the sector it has. The
       station lot is open to the sky at 768, so the slot along its north
       edge came out as a wall of BRICKRED three thousand and
       seventy-two long and seven hundred and sixty-eight tall, with the
       slot between the apron and the police lot crossing it. That is
       the brick cross eight storeys high the user photographed standing
       in an empty car park, and nothing else on the block was wrong
       with it. (The lots' `ceil: 2 * STOREY` is a red herring and worth
       saying so: a step between two patches of sky draws nothing — see
       the rule at the top of the band loop in js/mapgeo.js — so the lid
       over them was invisible. It was the void that showed.)

       THE CHECK IS THE GENERAL CASE, and it was run against the old
       geometry before it was written down here: rebuilt from those
       three rectangles alone it finds twelve of these, the tallest 768
