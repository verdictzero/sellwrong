/* =====================================================================
   GROCERY STORE SIMULATOR — real plants into the wood's own format
   =====================================================================

     node tools/bake-plants.mjs

   js/forest.js draws every plant as a billboard out of TWO pictures: an
   ALBEDO, which is the plant, and a BURN MAP, which is how it catches.
   The wood's own firs and ferns arrived as a finished pair in
   assets/forest/ and nothing in this repository made them. This does,
   for the town's trees and its hedges, so that a photograph dropped
   into art/plants/ becomes something the wood can plant.

   THE BURN MAP IS FOUR CHANNELS AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS INTERESTING.
   js/forest.js reads it as:

     R  coals    where embers sit after the flame has gone
     G  char     how black this texel goes
     B  order    WHEN this texel catches, 0 first and 1 last
     A  foliage  leaf rather than wood, which burns differently

   R, G and A come straight off the artwork: a green texel is foliage
   and chars hard; a brown one is trunk, holds its coals and keeps more
   of its own colour. ORDER is the one that has to be invented, and the
   invention is one sentence — FIRE STARTS AT THE FOOT AND GOES UP AND
   OUT. So order is the distance from the bottom centre of the sprite,
   normalised, with a little noise so a crown does not catch as a
   perfect arc. That is what a tree going up looks like from across a
   street, and it is the whole of the model.

   WHY NOT IN THE PAGE. Everything else the game draws, it draws at
   start-up. These are photographs: there is no set of primitives that
   gets you to a lime tree, the same argument tools/bake-art.mjs makes
   about the logo and the weapon. The difference is only where the
   result lands — art-data.js for those two, assets/forest/*.png here,
   because that is the format js/forest.js already loads.

   RUN IT BY HAND when art/plants/ changes, like bake-art.mjs. It is not
   in CI: the output is PNG, and two zlibs that disagree by a byte would
   fail a diff for no reason anybody could act on.
